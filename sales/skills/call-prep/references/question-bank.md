# Question Bank: Sales Call Preparation

## How to Use This Bank

Questions are organized by **objective** (what you're trying to learn), not by call type. Combine sets based on what you don't yet know about the deal.

**Rule of 5**: Pick no more than 5 questions per call. More questions = interrogation; fewer, well-chosen questions = conversation.

---

## Set 1: Understanding the Problem (Discovery)

Use when: First or second call; you need to understand their situation before pitching.

**Opening the conversation**:
- "Before I jump into what we do, help me understand what prompted this conversation — what made now the right time to look at this?"
- "What's the thing that's creating the most friction for your team right now?"
- "If you could fix one thing in [area] this quarter, what would it be?"

**Probing for depth** (use after they answer):
- "How long has that been the case?"
- "What have you already tried?"
- "What happens if it stays the way it is for another 12 months?"

**Quantifying the pain**:
- "How much time does your team spend on [problem] each week?"
- "Do you have a sense of what that's costing you — either in time, money, or missed opportunity?"
- "If you solved this by end of year, what would that be worth to the business?"

## Set 2: Understanding the Buying Process (Qualification)

Use when: You need to know how decisions get made before investing deeper.

**Decision process**:
- "Walk me through how a decision like this typically gets made here."
- "Who else needs to be involved before something like this moves forward?"
- "Have you done an evaluation like this before? How did that process work?"

**Budget**:
- "Is there a budget already allocated for this, or would this need to be justified?"
- "What's the approval process for something in this range?"
- "Is this coming out of [team] budget or is it a cross-functional decision?"

**Timeline**:
- "What's driving the timing here? Is there a deadline we should be working toward?"
- "If everything went well, when would you ideally want to have something in place?"
- "Are there any external events — audit, product launch, board meeting — that create a natural deadline?"

---

## Set 3: Understanding the Stakeholders (Mapping)

Use when: You've had one call but haven't mapped the buying committee.

- "Who else would you normally involve in a decision like this?"
- "Is there a technical team that would need to evaluate this?"
- "Who signs off on contracts at your company? Is it the same person who owns the budget?"
- "Is there a CFO or Finance person who typically needs to approve projects at this level?"
- "Who would be the day-to-day user of this, and would they have a say in the decision?"

---

## Set 4: Understanding the Competition (Late Discovery)

Use when: The deal is progressing and you need to know who else they're talking to.

- "Are you evaluating any other solutions alongside this?"
- "What would you say [Competitor X] does particularly well, from what you've seen?"
- "What's the biggest concern you have about [any vendor] in this space?"
- "What would make you confident that you're making the right choice?"

---

## Set 5: Advancing the Deal (Next Step Creation)

Use at the end of every call, every time.

- "Based on what we covered today, does it make sense to take the next step?"
- "What would need to happen on your end before we could move to [next stage]?"
- "If we do [specific next action], could we target a decision by [date]?"
- "Who else should be in the room for our next conversation?"
- "Is there anything that could derail this between now and then that I should know about?"

---

## Set 6: Check-In / Temperature Check

Use when: A deal has gone quiet or you want to understand where things stand.

- "I want to make sure I'm not misreading the situation — where are things from your perspective?"
- "Has anything changed since we last spoke that I should know about?"
- "On a scale of 1–10, how confident are you that this project moves forward this quarter?"
- "Is there something I could be doing differently to make this easier on your end?"

---

## Set 7: Champion Development

Use with your internal champion to strengthen the relationship and deal.

- "What's the internal conversation looking like? Are there other voices we need to get aligned?"
- "What would your CEO / CFO need to hear to be comfortable with this?"
- "If you were in my shoes, what would you do differently at this point?"
- "What's the biggest risk to this project moving forward — from inside your organization?"
