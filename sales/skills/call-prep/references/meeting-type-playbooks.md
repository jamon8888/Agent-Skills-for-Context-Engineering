# Meeting Type Playbooks

## How to Use

Select the playbook that matches your upcoming meeting. Each playbook covers:
- Pre-call mental model (what mode to be in)
- The critical question to answer before the meeting starts
- Agenda structure
- Common traps to avoid
- What success looks like

## Playbook 1: Cold / Discovery Call (First Meeting)

**Mental Model**: You are there to learn, not to sell. You should be talking 30% of the time; they should be talking 70%.

**Critical Pre-Call Question**: "What is the one thing I want to understand by the end of this call that I don't know now?"

**Agenda Structure**:
1. (2 min) Set the agenda: "Here's what I thought we could cover — does that work for you?"
2. (15 min) Their situation: Open discovery questions
3. (5 min) Brief context on us: Only after understanding their problem
4. (3 min) Next step: Specific proposal, not "let me know if you want to talk again"

**Traps**:
- Pitching before you understand the problem → You'll over-explain features they don't care about
- Letting the call end without a concrete next step → "I'll follow up" is not a next step
- Asking yes/no questions → "Are you happy with your current solution?" gets a useless answer

**Success**: You leave knowing (1) their specific pain, (2) what a solution would need to do, (3) who else is involved, and (4) a confirmed next action.

## Playbook 2: Demo / Presentation

**Mental Model**: This is a customized proof, not a product tour. Every screen you show should answer a question they've already told you they have.

**Critical Pre-Call Question**: "What specific problem am I solving in this demo, and which customer story most closely mirrors their situation?"

**Pre-Work**:
- Review discovery notes: What exact pain did they articulate?
- Identify the 2–3 features most relevant to them; skip the rest
- Prepare 1 customer story from a company similar to them
- Confirm attendees: who is in the room, and what are their individual priorities?

**Agenda Structure**:
1. (3 min) Recap: "Last time you mentioned X and Y — does that still reflect your priorities?"
2. (20 min) Focused demo: Show only what solves their stated problems
3. (7 min) Q&A: Let them drive
4. (5 min) Next step: Propose the next concrete milestone

**Traps**:
- Starting the demo without recapping their situation → You lose personalization immediately
- Showing features they didn't ask about → Signals you weren't listening
- Ending without addressing the likely objection → Most prospects won't ask; you need to invite it

**Success**: They say something like "that's exactly what we need" or ask a technical/commercial follow-up question (both are buying signals). You leave with a clear next step tied to a date.

## Playbook 3: Proposal / Pricing Review

**Mental Model**: This is a negotiation in disguise. Come prepared to handle objections and defend your value — not to present slides.

**Critical Pre-Call Question**: "What is the most likely pushback, and what is my response?"

**Pre-Work**:
- Confirm who will be on the call — if the Economic Buyer isn't there, consider rescheduling
- Prepare a 1-paragraph ROI summary (they will not read the whole proposal)
- Anticipate the top 3 objections (price, timing, competition)
- Define your BATNA (see `negotiation-advisor`): what can you trade vs. what is non-negotiable?

**Agenda Structure**:
1. (5 min) Summary: "The goal of today is to see if this makes sense for you. Let me take 5 minutes on the business case, then you tell me your reaction."
2. (10 min) ROI walkthrough, not proposal page-by-page
3. (15 min) Q&A and objection handling
4. (5 min) Next step: Either advance to legal/procurement, or set a decision deadline

**Traps**:
- Walking through every line of the proposal → Death by PowerPoint; focus on value, not content
- Caving on price at the first push → Signals the price was wrong. Hold position; ask clarifying questions first.
- Ending without a decision timeline → Proposals without deadlines drift forever

**Success**: Clear verbal agreement to move forward, or a specific list of outstanding questions with an agreed timeline to resolve them.

## Playbook 4: Negotiation Call

**Mental Model**: A negotiation is an exchange, not an argument. Your job is to understand their constraints and find a deal that works for both sides.

**Critical Pre-Call Question**: "What am I willing to trade, and what am I not?"

**Pre-Work** (run `negotiation-advisor`):
- Define your BATNA: what happens if this deal doesn't close?
- Define your ZOPA: what is the range of acceptable outcomes?
- List your trading variables: payment terms, contract length, scope, timing, references
- Prepare your Accusation Audit: anticipate every negative thing they'll say about you and address it first

**Traps**:
- Revealing your floor too early → Anchors the negotiation against you
- Giving without getting → "I'll reduce by X" without asking for anything in return is a donation
- Treating every objection as final → Most objections are opening positions, not conclusions

**Success**: A signed deal at acceptable economics, OR a clear understanding of what bridge remains and a timeline to close it.

## Playbook 5: Check-In / Relationship Call

**Mental Model**: This is a listening session. You are not there to sell; you are there to learn what's changed and whether the relationship is healthy.

**Critical Pre-Call Question**: "Is this account at risk, and how would I know?"

**Agenda Structure**:
1. (10 min) Business review: How are things going? What's changed since we last spoke?
2. (10 min) Product/service health: What's working? What could be better?
3. (5 min) Forward look: What are their priorities for next quarter?
4. (5 min) Any expansion opportunity to surface? (Plant seed only — don't pitch)

**Traps**:
- Turning a check-in into an upsell pitch → Destroys trust; they'll dread your calls
- Not asking about dissatisfaction directly → "Everything's fine" is not the same as a healthy relationship; probe deeper
- Ending without a clear follow-up action → Even a small one ("I'll send you that resource") signals you're paying attention

**Success**: You leave knowing their current satisfaction level, any risks on the horizon, and at least one thing you can do to add value before the next scheduled touchpoint.

## Playbook 6: Executive / C-Suite Meeting

**Mental Model**: Executives think in strategic outcomes and organizational risk. They do not care about features.

**Critical Pre-Call Question**: "What decision does this executive need to make, and what would make them comfortable making it?"

**Pre-Work**:
- Research their recent public statements (earnings calls, LinkedIn, press releases)
- Identify their company's top 3 strategic priorities for the year
- Prepare an Executive Summary: 1 page, business outcomes only, no product jargon
- Confirm: is this an information meeting or a decision meeting? Know which before you walk in.

**Agenda Structure**:
1. (2 min) Context: Why are we here and what do we want to accomplish?
2. (15 min) Their priorities: "What are the 2–3 things you're most focused on this year?"
3. (8 min) Strategic alignment: Where does our work together fit into those priorities?
4. (5 min) Next step: Keep it executive-level — no tactical details

**Traps**:
- Leading with product → Immediately loses executive attention
- Spending more than 2 minutes on your company background → They don't care until they know you understand them
- Letting the champion do all the talking → Executives need to hear from you directly

**Success**: The executive is engaged, asks follow-up questions about strategic fit, and either sponsors next steps directly or explicitly endorses the champion to proceed.
