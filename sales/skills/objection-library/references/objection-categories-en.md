## PRICE OBJECTIONS

### 1. "It's too expensive."

**What They Really Mean**: "I don't yet believe the ROI justifies the price" or "I'm comparing to a cheaper alternative without understanding the full picture."

**Acknowledge**: "That's a fair reaction — we're not the cheapest option."

**Clarify**: "When you say it's too expensive, is the concern the absolute number, or is it more about whether the value is worth it at that number?"

**Answer (ROI Reframe)**:
"Let me share how [Similar Customer] looked at it. They were budgeting $X annually on [the problem]. Our solution costs $Y. They got to payback in [timeframe] and are now saving $Z per quarter. I want to make sure we're looking at the full picture — not just the cost of us, but the cost of the current situation."

**Answer (Silence)**: Make your case, then stop talking. Do not fill the silence with concessions.

**What to Avoid**: Never apologize for your price. Never lead with "I understand, and here's a discount." Discounting without resistance signals the price was wrong.

---

### 2. "We don't have budget for this."

**What They Really Mean**: Often means the budget isn't allocated — not that it doesn't exist. Or: the priority hasn't been established internally.

**Acknowledge**: "That makes sense — unplanned spend is a harder conversation."

**Clarify**: "Is the issue that the budget literally doesn't exist for this category, or more that it hasn't been allocated yet for this fiscal year?"

**Answer (Reframe as investment)**:
"What we typically see is that when the business case is strong enough, budget gets found. Can we build the ROI model together and see if it makes sense to take that conversation internally? The worst case is you have a clearer picture of the value."

**Answer (Timing pivot)**:
"When does your next budget cycle open? If the value makes sense, it's worth starting the internal conversation now so we can move quickly when the window opens."

---

### 3. "Your competitor is cheaper."

**What They Really Mean**: They're using price as leverage, or they genuinely don't see sufficient differentiation.

**Acknowledge**: "Good — I'm glad you're comparing options. That's exactly what you should do."

**Clarify**: "Can I ask — what specifically did they offer at that price? I want to make sure you're comparing the same scope."

**Answer (Differentiation)**:
"There are a few things worth comparing directly. [Competitor] is strong at [X]. Where we're different is [specific differentiator backed by evidence]. If [differentiator] is important to your situation, the price delta looks different. If it's not, they might be the right choice."

**What to Avoid**: Never badmouth the competitor. Never match their price without a trade.

---

### 4. "We need a discount to move forward."

**What They Really Mean**: They're testing your flexibility. Often the first ask, not the final ask.

**Acknowledge**: "I hear you — you want to make sure you're getting the best deal."

**Clarify**: "Help me understand — is the budget constraint absolute, or is there flexibility if the business case is strong?"

**Answer (Trade, don't give)**:
"I can't reduce the price without changing something else. But here's what I *can* do: if you can commit to [annual vs. monthly / faster start date / expansion clause], I have more room to work with. What makes sense on your end?"

**What to Avoid**: Never give a discount without a trade. "If I do X, can you do Y" — not "here's 10% off."

---

### 5. "The ROI isn't clear enough."

**What They Really Mean**: They need the business case built for them to take internally, or they genuinely haven't connected your solution to their specific numbers.

**Acknowledge**: "Fair — an investment at this level should have a clear return."

**Clarify**: "If we could quantify what this problem is costing you today — in time, revenue, or risk — would that help you make the case internally?"

**Answer**:
"Let's build it together. Walk me through what [current process / problem] costs you per month. Usually it's a combination of [hours × rate] + [error cost] + [opportunity cost of not having solved it]. In our experience with companies your size, that number tends to be $X–Y per year. Does that align with what you're seeing?"

---

## TIMING OBJECTIONS

### 6. "Now isn't the right time."

**What They Really Mean**: Either there's no urgency, or there's a competing internal priority that hasn't been disclosed.

**Acknowledge**: "I understand — there's never a perfect time for a new initiative."

**Clarify**: "What would need to be true for the timing to feel right? Is there a specific event or decision that needs to happen first?"

**Answer (Compelling Event)**:
"The reason I ask is that most of our customers who said 'not right now' and then moved forward did so because of [type of event: audit, headcount change, competitive pressure]. Is any of that on your radar for this year?"

**Answer (Seed for later)**:
"That's completely fair. Can we agree to revisit on [specific date]? And between now and then, would it be useful to have the business case built so you're ready to move when the time is right?"

---

### 7. "Budget is frozen / locked until next year."

**Acknowledge**: "That's a real constraint — budget cycles can be rigid."

**Clarify**: "When does the new cycle open? And when do you typically start planning for it?"

**Answer**:
"If your planning cycle opens in [month], the best time to start the evaluation is actually now — so the decision is ready when the budget window opens. That way you're not losing 6–8 weeks of evaluation time while competitors are already implementing."

---

### 9. "We have too many priorities right now."

**Acknowledge**: "That's real — I don't want to add to an already full plate."

**Clarify**: "What are the top two things your team is focused on this quarter? I want to understand where this would sit relative to those."

**Answer (Tie to their priority)**:
"Actually, [their stated priority] is something we'd accelerate, not compete with. Companies using our solution for [their priority] typically see [result]. It might be the same project, not an additional one."

---

## TRUST / RISK OBJECTIONS

### 10. "We prefer a known vendor / We've never heard of you."

**Acknowledge**: "That's a reasonable concern — switching to an unknown vendor carries risk."

**Clarify**: "When you say 'known vendor', is the concern about longevity and support, or more about whether your leadership will be comfortable with the decision?"

**Answer (Social proof)**:
"Here's what I can offer: [Customer name in their industry, similar size] made the same switch from [known vendor] 18 months ago. I'd suggest getting them on a 20-minute call — they can speak to what the decision process was like internally and what the outcome has been. Would that be useful?"

---

### 11. "We tried something like this before and it didn't work."

**Acknowledge**: "That kind of experience is frustrating — and it makes sense that you'd be skeptical."

**Clarify**: "What specifically went wrong? Was it the product, the implementation, the adoption, or something else?"

**Answer (Address the specific gap)**:
"The most common reason these projects fail is [specific failure mode relevant to their answer]. The way we've addressed that is [specific approach]. Would it be worth showing you exactly how that works in our implementation process?"

---

### 12. "We need more references / proof."

**Acknowledge**: "Absolutely — I wouldn't ask you to take our word for it."

**Answer**:
"I can connect you with [Customer A] in your industry who had a similar situation, and [Customer B] who came from a competing product. Who would be most relevant to talk to — a technical contact or a business stakeholder?"

---

## PROCESS OBJECTIONS

### 14. "We need to evaluate other options."

**Acknowledge**: "You should — this is an important decision."

**Clarify**: "Who else is in the evaluation? And what criteria are you using to make the final call?"

**Answer (Influence the criteria)**:
"That's helpful to know. One thing I'd suggest adding to your evaluation criteria is [specific dimension where you win]. Most evaluations don't include it upfront, but it tends to matter a lot once you're in implementation. How does your team feel about [that dimension]?"

---

### 15. "I need to run this by [person not in the room]."

**Acknowledge**: "Of course — a decision like this shouldn't be made by one person."

**Clarify**: "Who specifically? And what would they need to see to be comfortable moving forward?"

**Answer (Get access)**:
"Would it make sense for me to be in that conversation? I can address technical or financial questions directly, which saves you from being the go-between. Does [that person] have 20 minutes this week?"

---

### 16. "We'll build this internally."

**Acknowledge**: "That's a legitimate path — some companies do."

**Clarify**: "Have you scoped it? I'm curious what you're estimating in terms of build time and engineering cost."

**Answer (Build vs. buy math)**:
"The companies that have done this typically find the build takes [X months] and requires [Y engineers]. At a blended rate of $[Z]/hr, that's $[total]. Then there's the ongoing maintenance. Our product was built over [time] by [team size] — you'd be starting from scratch. If build-vs-buy makes sense to pressure-test, I'm happy to walk through the comparison."

---

## VALUE / FIT OBJECTIONS

### 18. "We're not sure we need this."

**What They Really Mean**: Pain hasn't been established. Either you moved to pitch too fast, or the champion hasn't surfaced the problem to you.

**Acknowledge**: "That's an important thing to be honest about."

**Clarify**: "Can I ask — what made you agree to take this meeting? There was something that prompted it."

**Answer (Back to discovery)**:
"Let's take a step back. I don't want to sell you something you don't need. Tell me more about [the area you believe is a problem]. What does your current [process/situation] look like?"

---

### 20. "Our situation is different — this wasn't built for us."

**Acknowledge**: "You're right that every situation is different — and you know your situation better than I do."

**Clarify**: "What specifically feels different? Is it your industry, your scale, your tech stack, or something else?"

**Answer**:
"The reason I think we might be a good fit is [specific connection between their situation and your ICP]. I'm not asking you to take that on faith — [Customer X] said the same thing before going live. Would it be worth a 20-minute technical deep-dive to see if the fit is actually there?"

## Notes on French Adaptations

See `objection-categories-fr.md` for adapted scripts. Key cultural differences:

- French prospects are more comfortable with directness and intellectual debate — meet them at that level
- Price objections in French B2B contexts often reflect process concerns, not budget reality
- "On va y réfléchir" ("We'll think about it") is the French equivalent of a soft no — treat like Objection 6
- Formal vouvoiement is expected until they shift to tutoiement; don't use tu prematurely
- ROI framing works well; case studies from French or Francophone companies are far more persuasive than US examples
