## Assumptions & Bets

*Record the explicit bets this plan makes. Review against reality at quarter end.*

1. [Segment X] will convert at [Y]% win rate because [reason]
2. [Account Z] will move to active evaluation by [date] because [signal]
3. Whitespace in [vertical] is higher priority than [other vertical] because [reason]

**If these assumptions are wrong**: flag for `win-loss-analyzer` quarterly review.
