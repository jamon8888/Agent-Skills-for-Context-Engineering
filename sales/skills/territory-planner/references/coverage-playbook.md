# Coverage Playbook

## The 4 Gap Types

Every uncovered account falls into one of four categories. Each requires a different play.

---

### Gap Type 1: Whitespace
**Definition**: High ICP fit (≥60), never contacted or no activity in 90+ days.
**Why it matters**: These are your highest-probability new logos. They match your profile but have never heard your pitch.

**Play**:
1. Research one trigger event (hiring, funding, product launch, leadership change)
2. Craft a 3-line opener referencing the trigger — not your product
3. Target the Economic Buyer, not the end user
4. Goal of first touch: secure a 15-minute call, not a demo

**Example opener**:
> "Saw [Company] just hired a Head of [Function] — usually means [pain point] is becoming a priority. Happy to share how [similar company] handled this. Worth 15 minutes?"

---

### Gap Type 2: Dormant Champions
**Definition**: Previously engaged (meetings, emails, demos), but gone quiet for 30–90 days.
**Why it matters**: They already know you. Re-engagement costs 5× less than net new.

**Diagnosis first — why did they go quiet?**
- Budget freeze → wait for quarter end, then re-engage with ROI framing
- Champion left → find the new owner immediately
- Evaluating competitor → bring a new angle (case study, pricing move, new feature)
- Just busy → a short "still relevant?" note is enough

**Play**:
1. Check the last interaction note — what was the stated blocker?
2. Find a new trigger event since last contact
3. Reference the last conversation: "Last time we spoke, [X] was the blocker — has that changed?"
4. Don't restart from zero. Pick up the thread.

---

### Gap Type 3: Shallow Coverage
**Definition**: Active account, but only one contact in a multi-stakeholder buying group.
**Why it matters**: Single-threaded deals lose 3× more often than multi-threaded deals (Gong data). If your contact leaves, the deal dies.

**Play**:
1. Map the full buying committee (Economic Buyer, Champion, Technical Evaluator, Influencer)
2. Ask your champion directly: "Who else will weigh in on this decision?"
3. Offer champion a reason to introduce you upward: "Would it help to give your CFO a quick ROI summary?"
4. Target at least 3 contacts in any T1 deal

**Stakeholder map template**:
| Role | Name | Sentiment | Last Contact | Next Action |
|------|------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Economic Buyer | ? | Unknown | Never | Get intro from Champion |
| Champion | [Name] | Positive | 5 days ago | Ask for EB intro |
| Technical Eval | ? | Unknown | Never | Send technical overview |

---

### Gap Type 4: Wrong-Level Coverage
**Definition**: Active relationship, but only with end users or mid-level managers — not Economic Buyers or executives.
**Why it matters**: Deals stall when your champion can't get budget approved because you've never built credibility above them.

**Play**:
1. Never ask your contact to "pass your deck up the chain" — they will summarize it poorly
2. Build something specifically for the executive level: a 1-page business case, an ROI model, a peer reference
3. Offer to co-present with your champion: "I can join the 10 minutes you have with your VP — I'll handle the business case section"
4. If access is blocked: work around by getting a mutual connection, an exec sponsor from your side, or a LinkedIn touchpoint directly

## Re-engagement Sequence

For Dormant Champions and Whitespace accounts, use this 3-touch sequence before marking as unresponsive:

**Touch 1 — Trigger-based** (Day 1)
Reference a specific external event. No product pitch.

**Touch 2 — Value drop** (Day 5)
Share one piece of content directly relevant to their role/pain. No ask.

**Touch 3 — The clean break** (Day 12)
"I've reached out a couple of times — clearly the timing isn't right. I'll step back. If [pain] becomes a priority, happy to reconnect."

This sequence has a 40–60% re-engagement rate on dormant accounts. The "clean break" message often gets the highest reply rate.

## Quarterly Coverage Review Checklist

Run this at the start of each quarter:

- [ ] All T1 accounts have at least 2 contacts mapped
- [ ] No T1 account has been untouched for 14+ days
- [ ] All whitespace accounts (ICP ≥ 70) have been contacted at least once
- [ ] All dormant champions (no activity 60+ days) have been reviewed — either re-engaged or deprioritized
- [ ] Territory plan assumptions validated against actual win rate by segment
- [ ] ICP score recalibrated if win patterns diverged from predictions
