# Champion Signals: Behavioral Indicators

## Positive Champion Signals (Champion is Healthy)

These behaviors indicate an engaged, capable champion. Reward and reinforce them.

| Signal | What It Means | How to Respond |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Shares internal org chart or politics | Trust is high | Reciprocate: share something sensitive about your roadmap or pricing flexibility |
| Introduces you to their boss unprompted | Power + commitment | Prepare an executive-level brief for that meeting; don't wing it |
| Tells you about a competing initiative | Coaching you | Ask: "What would need to happen for this to take priority over that?" |
| Forwards your emails internally | Acting as internal sales rep | Give them better content: executive summary, business case template |
| Pushes back on your approach | Invested in success | Welcome this; it means they're thinking like an owner |
| Calls/messages outside of scheduled meetings | Motivated | Available for quick coaching sessions; ask "What's the latest?" |
| Uses "we" language about the project | Identity investment | Reinforce their ownership; ask for their input on success metrics |

## Warning Signals (Champion Cooling)

These signals require immediate attention. A fading champion = a dying deal.

| Signal | Likely Cause | Intervention |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Slower email response (was fast, now slow) | Losing confidence internally or deprioritizing | Check-in call: "I want to make sure we're still on track — anything changed on your end?" |
| Missed scheduled meetings without rescheduling | Political headwinds or internal competition | Ask directly: "Is there anything making it harder to keep this moving?" |
| Starts saying "we" → shifts to "they" | Distancing from the project | Find out who "they" is; may need to identify a new champion |
| Stops sharing internal context | Trust erosion or conflict of interest | Vulnerability move: share a risk or challenge on your side to invite reciprocity |
| Forwards decision to committee without warning | Losing executive support | Request an emergency executive touchpoint to reset expectations |
| Starts quoting competitor capabilities | Champion is being lobbied | Counter with a direct competitive response; involve your SE or leadership |

## Champion vs. Sponsor: The Critical Distinction

| Attribute | Sponsor | Champion |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Likes your product | ✓ | ✓ |
| Will say nice things about you | ✓ | ✓ |
| Will advocate when asked | Sometimes | Always |
| Will advocate without being asked | Rarely | Yes |
| Will risk their reputation for you | No | Yes |
| Has organizational power | Maybe | Required |
| Will share internal politics | Rarely | Yes |

**Implication**: A sponsor is a starting point, not an endpoint. Your job is to develop sponsors into champions, or find additional contacts who are already champions.

## The Champion's Personal Win

Every champion needs a personal win from the deal. Ask yourself: what does this person get if the project succeeds?

| Champion Profile | Likely Personal Win | How to Reinforce |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Ambitious manager | Promotion trigger, visible win | Position project as leadership proof point |
| Overworked ops lead | Time savings, reduced pain | Quantify hours saved per week; make it their ROI story |
| New executive (hired < 12 months) | Quick win to establish credibility | Accelerate: propose a phased delivery with early results |
| Technical lead | Technical credibility, career development | Involve them in solution design; credit them in case study |
| Finance champion | Budget efficiency, risk mitigation | ROI model in their language; show cost of inaction |

**Key Question to Ask**: "If this project succeeds, what does that mean for you personally?"
