# Negotiation Scripts (Battle-Tested)

## 1. The "Price Pushback" (Classic)

**Scenario**: "Your price is too high. Competitor X is cheaper."

**Response (The Pivot):**

> "I hear you. Price is a major factor. If you're looking for the cheapest option, Competitor X is actually a great fit. They do A and B reasonably well.
>
> However, we built our solution for teams who need C and D (Unique Value). Is C and D critical for you right now, or is cost the only driver?"

## 2. The "Budget Constraint"

**Scenario**: "We only have $X budget." (It's 20% below your price).

**Response (The Scope Chop):**

> "I appreciate you sharing that number. We want to work with you.
>
> At $X, we can't do the full package. However, if we remove [Feature A] and [Support Tier B], we can get closer to that number. Which parts of the solution are 'Nice to Have' vs 'Must Have'?"

## 3. The "Ghosting" Breaker (The Flying Fish)

**Scenario**: They stopped replying after the proposal.

**Response (The "Done?" Email):**

> Subject: Permission to close file?
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I haven't heard back on the proposal. I'm assuming this project isn't a priority right now, so I'm going to close the file on my end to stop bothering you.
>
> Is that fair?
>
> Best,
> [You]

## 4. The "Deadline" Trap

**Scenario**: "We need to sign today." (Fake urgency).

**Response (The Slow Down):**

> "It seems like there's a lot of urgency here. Help me understand—what happens if we don't sign today? Does the project break?"
