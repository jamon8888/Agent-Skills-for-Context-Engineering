# Negotiation Frameworks

## 1. The Harvard Method (Principled Negotiation)

### BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)

- **Concept**: Your power comes from your ability to walk away.
- **Action**: Always know your Plan B before entering the room. If your Plan B is strong, you can negotiate harder.

### ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement)

- **Concept**: The overlap between your minimum price and their maximum budget.
- **Action**: Trying to find this zone without revealing your floor.

## 2. The Voss Method (Tactical Empathy)

### Labeling

- **Concept**: Validating their emotion to diffuse it.
- **Format**: "It seems like..." / "It sounds like..." / "It looks like..."
- **Example**: "It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure to cut costs." (They will say "Yes, exactly!" and give you information).

### Mirroring

- **Concept**: Repeating the last 3 words (or critical words) as a question.
- **Goal**: Encourages them to elaborate without you asking a direct question.
- **Example**:
  - Buyer: "We just don't have the budget."
  - You: "Have the budget?"
  - Buyer: "Well, we do, but it's allocated to Q4 marketing..." (Boom, you found the money).

### Accusation Audit

- **Concept**: Listing all the terrible things they might think about you _before_ they say them.
- **Goal**: Clears the air and disarms them.
- **Example**: "You're probably thinking this is expensive. You're thinking we're a small risky startup. You might even think I'm crazy for asking this."

## 3. The "Trade" Method (Variables)

Never give a naked concession. Always attach a "If I..., Then You..." string.

### Variables (Things to Trade)

- **Price**: The cost.
- **Volume**: Number of seats/license.
- **Duration**: 1 year vs 3 year.
- **Payment Terms**: Net 30 vs Net 60 vs Upfront.
- **Start Date**: Sign now, start later?
- **Case Study**: Will they be a reference?
- **Scope**: Remove features to lower price.
