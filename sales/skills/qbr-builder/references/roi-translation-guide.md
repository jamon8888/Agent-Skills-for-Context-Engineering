# ROI Translation Guide

## The Core Formula

```
Business Value = (Unit of Usage) × (Value Per Unit) × (Relevant Multiplier)
```

Every product metric must be translated into one of four business outcomes:
- **Revenue impact** (generated or protected)
- **Cost savings** (time, money, headcount)
- **Risk reduction** (compliance, churn, error rate)
- **Strategic advancement** (market position, speed to market)

## Common Metric Translations

### Time Savings

```
Hours saved = (Actions per month) × (Minutes saved per action) ÷ 60

Business value = Hours saved × (Average hourly cost of team)
```

Example:
- 200 reports generated via platform (vs. manual)
- Manual time per report: 45 minutes
- Hours saved: 200 × 45 / 60 = 150 hours
- Average analyst cost: $75/hr
- **Business value: $11,250 in labor costs this quarter**

---

### Revenue Protection (Churn Prevention)

```
Revenue protected = (At-risk accounts identified) × (Average ARR per account) × (Recovery rate)
```

Example:
- 8 accounts flagged as at-risk by health scoring
- 6 recovered through intervention
- Average ARR: $12,000
- **Revenue protected: $72,000**

---

### Sales Efficiency (Revenue Acceleration)

```
Pipeline impact = (Deals influenced by feature) × (Average deal size) × (Win rate lift)
```

Example:
- 12 deals where buyer engagement data was used in follow-up
- Average deal size: $25,000
- Win rate with engagement data: 48% vs. baseline 32%
- **Additional revenue: 12 × $25,000 × 16% = $48,000 in pipeline uplift**

---

### Error / Rework Reduction

```
Cost of errors avoided = (Error rate before) × (Volume) × (Cost per error to fix)
```

---

## Language Calibration by Audience

| Audience | Translate to | Avoid |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| CFO / Finance | Dollar amounts, ROI percentages, payback period | Feature names, usage counts |
| VP Operations | Hours saved, error rates, process velocity | Revenue projections |
| VP Sales | Pipeline impact, win rate, ramp time | Infrastructure metrics |
| Product/Tech | Adoption rate, API calls, error logs | Business KPIs (they'll ask) |
| CEO | Strategic outcome, competitive position | Any granular metric |

## The "So What?" Test

After every metric you plan to present, ask: "So what?"

If the answer requires another sentence to explain, you haven't finished translating.

❌ "We processed 12,000 events this quarter."
✅ "The platform processed 12,000 events this quarter, eliminating what would have been 2 FTE worth of manual data entry."

❌ "Active users increased 40%."
✅ "Active users grew 40% to 85% of your licensed seats — you're getting value from nearly every seat you're paying for."

## The Mixed Results Protocol

When results are below target, use this structure instead of hiding the data:

1. **State the result honestly**: "We targeted X; actual result was Y."
2. **Provide root cause**: "Based on our analysis, this was driven by [specific cause]."
3. **Own the controllable factors**: If it was a product or service gap, say so explicitly.
4. **Present the corrective plan**: "In Q+1, we are doing [specific action] to close this gap."
5. **Re-confirm commitment**: "We are committed to hitting X by [date] and will track it as a priority KPI."

**Why this matters**: Customers who witness vendors acknowledge and fix problems become stronger advocates than customers who only see success. Honesty is a competitive differentiator.
