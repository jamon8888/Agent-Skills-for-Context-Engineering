# Root Cause Framework: Win-Loss Analysis

## The 5 Whys Method (Sales Adaptation)

The 5 Whys is a root cause technique from lean manufacturing, adapted here for sales post-mortems. The goal is to **stop at the first cause you could have controlled** — not the one that feels most comfortable.

### Rules for Facilitating

1. **Start with the prospect's stated reason**, not the rep's narrative
2. Each "Why?" must be answered with evidence, not assumption
3. Stop when you reach a **process failure**, an **execution gap**, or a **qualification miss** — those are controllable
4. Do not stop at "the economy was bad" or "the competitor had deeper pockets" — those are symptoms, not causes

### Example: Applying the 5 Whys to a Price Loss

| Step | Statement |
|------|-----------|
| **Stated reason** | "They said we were too expensive." |
| **Why #1** | Why did price become the deciding factor? → "They couldn't see enough ROI to justify the premium." |
| **Why #2** | Why couldn't they see the ROI? → "We didn't quantify the cost of their current problem." |
| **Why #3** | Why didn't we quantify it? → "Discovery was surface-level — we never got to financial impact." |
| **Why #4** | Why was discovery surface-level? → "We moved to demo after the first call, before understanding the full picture." |
| **Root Cause** | We rushed to demo mode before completing financial discovery. This is a process failure. |

## The 6 Loss Categories

### 1. Value Gap
**Definition**: The prospect didn't believe the value justified the cost or change management effort.
**Signals**:
- "We're not sure we have this problem at that scale."
- "We can handle it internally."
- Evaluation ended at early stages with no strong objection

**Root Cause Questions**:
- Did we quantify their problem in their terms (dollars, hours, risk)?
- Did we show a before/after? Did we use a business case?
- Did we know their success metric before we proposed?

**Prevention**: Never leave a discovery call without a quantified pain statement. Ask: "If we solved this in 6 months, what would that mean for your business?"

---

### 2. Access Gap
**Definition**: We never reached the Economic Buyer. The deal died in middle management.
**Signals**:
- "Our champion couldn't get budget approved."
- Deal dragged at Proposal stage for weeks
- No one from the buying committee attended the demo

**Root Cause Questions**:
- Did we map the buying committee in Phase 1?
- Did we ask the champion: "Who else needs to sign off?"
- Did we offer to do an executive briefing?

**Prevention**: Ask the "Org Navigator" question in discovery: "Walk me through how a decision like this typically gets made here. Who would need to be involved before a contract is signed?"

---

### 3. Trust Gap
**Definition**: We were the riskier choice. The prospect chose safety over ROI.
**Signals**:
- "We went with a more established vendor."
- "We've heard of [Competitor] for longer."
- No reference call was offered or taken

**Root Cause Questions**:
- Did we offer social proof from similar customers?
- Did we address the "risky startup" concern explicitly?
- Did we propose a pilot or phased approach to reduce perceived risk?

**Prevention**: Build a "Trust Ladder" — match every concern about risk with a specific evidence item (case study, reference, analyst mention).

---

### 4. Price Gap
**Definition**: The prospect chose a cheaper alternative. Not because we were expensive, but because we failed to anchor value.
**Signals**:
- "Competitor X is 30% cheaper."
- The negotiation opened with price, not value
- No ROI model was presented

**Root Cause Questions**:
- Did we present an ROI model before we presented pricing?
- Did we build the financial case before the proposal?
- Did we know their budget range before we sent a number?

**Prevention**: Always present the cost of inaction before the cost of the solution. "Your current situation costs you $X/year. Our solution costs $Y. The question isn't whether $Y is affordable — it's whether saving $X is worth it."

---

### 5. Timing Gap
**Definition**: The deal had no urgency. It was real, but it could wait.
**Signals**:
- "Let's revisit next quarter."
- Evaluation paused mid-process with no explanation
- No deadline or burning platform cited

**Root Cause Questions**:
- Did we identify a Compelling Event in discovery?
- Did we tie the problem to a deadline the prospect owns?
- Did we create urgency, or assume it existed?

**Prevention**: Hunt for Compelling Events: audits, board deadlines, competitive threats, headcount changes. If none exist, you may be selling to a want, not a need.

---

### 6. Process Gap
**Definition**: Our sales execution was weaker than the competitor's. They ran a better evaluation.
**Signals**:
- "We felt [Competitor] understood us better."
- Our demo was generic; theirs was tailored
- Our proposal didn't address their specific requirements

**Root Cause Questions**:
- Was our demo personalized to their use case?
- Did we confirm proposal format before sending?
- Did we do a dry-run or Mutual Success Plan?

**Prevention**: Use a Mutual Action Plan (MAP) on every deal above $10K. Align on milestones, owners, and dates together — don't manage the process unilaterally.

---

## The Last Recoverable Moment (LRM)

For every lost deal, identify the LRM: the last point in the process where a specific action could have changed the outcome.

**How to find it**:
1. List the timeline of key events
2. Mark where the prospect's engagement peaked, then declined
3. The LRM is usually 1-2 interactions before the decline began
4. Ask: "What could we have done differently at that moment?"

**Why it matters**: The LRM converts a loss into a coaching moment. Instead of "we lost because of price," you get "we lost because on the third call, we failed to introduce the CFO to our ROI model before budget freeze was announced."

## Win Autopsy: What to Look For

Wins deserve the same rigor as losses.

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| What was the specific trigger that started the evaluation? | Identifies your best inbound signals |
| Who was our champion and what made them effective? | Defines the ideal internal champion profile |
| What objection came up that we handled well? | Builds your objection handling playbook |
| What did we do in discovery that unlocked the deal? | Identifies the questions worth replicating |
| What did the competitor do wrong? | Your competitive edge |
| What would have killed the deal if we'd done it wrong? | Your highest-risk moments |
