# Subject Line Guide

## The Core Rules

1. **3–6 words** is the optimal range for B2B cold outreach
2. **Lowercase** unless a proper noun — it scans as personal, not broadcast
3. **Specific > clever** — "Q3 hiring plans at Acme" beats "Curious about your growth"
4. **Never lie or mislead** — "Re:" on a cold email is a trust-killer

## The Formulas (with Examples)

### 1. The Name Drop
Format: `[Company] + [relevant observation]`
Examples:
- `Acme's hiring push`
- `Series B and what comes next`
- `Your LinkedIn post on [topic]`

Best for: Signal-triggered outreach where you have a specific reason to write.

---

### 2. The Question
Format: A short, direct question that invites curiosity
Examples:
- `Still using [Old Tool]?`
- `How are you handling [problem]?`
- `Quick thought on [their initiative]`

Best for: Cold outreach where you've done research but have no personal connection.

---

### 3. The Mutual Connection
Format: Name drop a shared contact or context
Examples:
- `[Mutual contact] suggested I reach out`
- `We were both at [Event]`

Best for: Warm introductions; authenticity required.

---

### 4. The Specific Number
Format: Numbers in subject lines create pattern interrupts
Examples:
- `3 things from your job posting`
- `15 minutes on [topic]`
- `One idea for [Company]'s [goal]`

Best for: Follow-up or account-based outreach.

---

### 5. The Bold Claim
Format: A provocative but honest statement
Examples:
- `[Competitor] is targeting your accounts`
- `Your [process] is costing you X`
- `[Industry trend] is about to hit [Company]`

Best for: When you have strong competitive intel or market insight to offer.

## What to Avoid

| Pattern | Why It Fails | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Question + feature | Telegraphs pitch immediately | "Want to improve your sales process?" |
| The Faux-Re | Trust violation if used on first contact | "Re: your website" |
| Emoji in B2B cold | Signals broadcast, not personal | "🚀 Exciting news for your team!" |
| All-caps words | Reads as spam | "IMPORTANT: sales opportunity" |
| Vague curiosity | No specific hook | "Thought this might be relevant" |
| "Quick" anything | Everyone says this; means nothing | "Quick question for you" |

## French Subject Lines

French email norms allow slightly more formal and complete subject lines.

| English | French Equivalent | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| `Acme's hiring push` | `Croissance chez Acme` | More formal structure acceptable |
| `Still using [Tool]?` | `Vous utilisez encore [Tool] ?` | Note the space before ? in French |
| `3 thoughts on your Q3` | `3 observations sur votre Q3` | Numbers work in French too |
| `Quick question` | `Une question rapide` | Still weak; prefer specific subjects |

---

## A/B Testing Framework

When volume allows (20+ sends), test:

| Variable | Test A | Test B |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Length | Short (3 words) | Medium (5–6 words) |
| Format | lowercase | Title Case |
| Framing | Trigger-based | Problem-based |
| Persona | Name of person | Name of company |

Track: Open rate (subject line), Reply rate (full email). Optimize for replies, not opens.
