A library of real rewrites demonstrating the scoring rubric in practice.

## Example 1: Cold Outreach — Before

**Subject**: Exciting partnership opportunity
**Score**: 28/100

```
Hi [First Name],

Hope this email finds you well!

I wanted to reach out to introduce myself. My name is [Name] and I'm 
the Head of Partnerships at [Company]. We have an exciting platform 
that's been helping companies like yours drive seamless efficiency 
across their go-to-market operations.

I'd love to find a time to connect and explore potential synergies 
between our organizations. Would you be open to a quick 30-minute 
call this week?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
[Name]
```

**Flags**:
- Subject: "Exciting partnership opportunity" — vague, broadcast feel, no hook
- Opener: "Hope this email finds you well" — delete immediately
- "I wanted to reach out" — weak; just reach out
- "seamless efficiency" — slop
- "synergies" — corporate filler
- "companies like yours" — lazy; say which companies
- Two CTAs (find a time + would you be open) — pick one

## Example 1: Cold Outreach — After

**Subject**: Q3 hiring at [Company]
**Score**: 82/100

```
Hi [First Name],

Saw you're adding 3 SDRs this quarter — that usually means the 
ramp timeline becomes the bottleneck before anything else.

We cut SDR ramp time from 90 to 45 days at [Similar Company]. 
Happy to share what worked if you're thinking about the same problem.

15 minutes this week?

[Name]
```

**What changed**:
- Subject uses a specific, researched trigger (job postings)
- Opener starts with their situation, not self-introduction
- Body is a proof point, not a feature list (45 → 90 days at a named company)
- CTA is one, specific, and low-friction

## Example 2: Follow-Up After No Response — Before

**Subject**: Following up
**Score**: 35/100

```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email. I haven't heard back 
and wanted to make sure you received it.

I'm still very interested in connecting and believe we could add 
significant value to [Company].

Please let me know if you have some availability this week.

Thanks,
[Name]
```

**Flags**:
- Subject: "Following up" — no reason to open
- "I wanted to follow up" — weak starter
- "significant value" — hollow
- Passive ("let me know if you have some availability") — no specific ask

---

## Example 2: Follow-Up — After

**Subject**: Still relevant?
**Score**: 79/100

```
[First Name],

Sent a note last week about SDR ramp time — didn't want to assume 
timing is right if it isn't.

Still building out your Q3 team?

[Name]
```

**What changed**:
- Subject creates a mini-loop (is this still relevant to them?)
- Acknowledges prior email without apologizing for it
- Gives them an easy "no" while surfacing a useful question
- Extremely short — respects their time

---

## Example 3: Demo Follow-Up — Before

**Subject**: Great connecting today!
**Score**: 42/100

```
Hi [First Name],

It was a pleasure connecting with you today! I really enjoyed our 
conversation and learning more about [Company]'s challenges.

As discussed, I'm attaching our one-pager and pricing information. 
Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Looking forward to next steps!

[Name]
```

**Flags**:
- Subject: "Great connecting today!" — feels like a LinkedIn notification, not a business email
- "It was a pleasure" — filler
- "As discussed, I'm attaching" — passive and weak
- Throws everything at once (one-pager + pricing); no prioritization
- No next step defined; just "looking forward to next steps"

---

## Example 3: Demo Follow-Up — After

**Subject**: [Company] — next step
**Score**: 85/100

```
[First Name],

Per our conversation: the ramp problem you described is exactly 
what [Feature] addresses — the 45-day case study I mentioned is 
attached.

Before we go further, two things worth confirming on your end:
1. Who else needs to be in the room for the technical review?
2. Is the Q3 timeline still realistic from your side?

Once I know that, I'll send a proposed agenda for our next session.

[Name]
```

**What changed**:
- Subject: specific + forward-looking ("next step")
- Opens with the prospect's specific language from the call ("ramp problem")
- Anchors the case study to their stated problem before sharing it
- Advances the deal by asking two qualifying questions
- Clear next step owned by the sender, not the prospect
