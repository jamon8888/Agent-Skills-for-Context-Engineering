# Remediation Rules (English)

## 1. The "Orwell" Rule

Never use a long word where a short one will do.

- Utilize -> Use
- Implement -> Do/Start
- Leverage -> Use

## 2. Active Voice Mandate

- "Mistakes were made" -> "I made a mistake"
- "Efficiency is prioritized" -> "We prioritize efficiency"

## 3. Specificity Check

- "Significant growth" -> "20% growth"
- "Various stakeholders" -> "Developers and PMs"
