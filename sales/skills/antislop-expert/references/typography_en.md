# English Typography — Reference Rules

## Why Typography Matters

LLMs often produce "generic" typography or fail to respect specific style guides (like Oxford commas or curly quotes). A polished text respects the conventions of its language.

## Fundamental Rules

### Punctuation Spacing

- **The Golden Rule**: In English, there is NO space before double punctuation marks (: ; ! ?).
- Correct: "Do you want to come?"
- Incorrect: "Do you want to come ?" (French usage)

### Quotation Marks

- Use "curly quotes" (smart quotes) (`“` `”`) for text. Avoid straight quotes (`" `) unless in code blocks.
- Punctuation placement:
  - **US English**: Periods and commas go INSIDE quotes. ("We are here," he said.)
  - **UK English**: Periods and commas go OUTSIDE quotes unless part of the quote. ("We are here", he said.)
  - _Default for Solo_: Use US English unless specified otherwise.

### Dashes

- **Em-dash** (`—`) for breaks in thought: "The rule—while complex—is necessary." (No spaces around em-dashes is standard in US publishing; some styles allow thin spaces).
- **En-dash** (`–`) for ranges: "1990–2000".
- **Hyphen** (`-`) for compound words: "well-known".

### Numbers and Units

- Use commas for thousands separators: 1,000,000.
- Currency symbol goes BEFORE the number: $100 (no space).
- Percent symbol goes immediately after the number: 50% (no space).

### Capitalization

- **Title Case**: Capitalize Major Words in Titles. (Not just the first word).
- **Sentence case**: Only for subheaders if specified by style guide.
- **Proper Nouns**: Always capitalize specific names of products, people, places.

### Serial Comma (Oxford Comma)

- Use the Oxford comma before the conjunction in a list of items.
- Correct: "I bought apples, oranges, and bananas."
- Incorrect: "I bought apples, oranges and bananas." (Can be ambiguous).

## Common AI Typography Errors

- **Bolding abuse**: Overusing **bold text** to emphasize obvious points.
- **Bullet pointitis**: Using lists where a paragraph would flow better.
- **Title Case/Sentence Case confusion**: Mixing styles in headers.
- **Straight quotes**: Using coder quotes instead of typesetter quotes.
