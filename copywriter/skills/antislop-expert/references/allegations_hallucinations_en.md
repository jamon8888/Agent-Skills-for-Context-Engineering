# Allegations, Hallucinations & Sourcing

## Taxonomy of Allegations

### Verifiable Allegation

A testable statement containing at least one factual element:

- Precise date: "in March 2024".
- Number: "47% of companies".
- Named institution: "according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics".
- Described mechanism: "raising interest rates reduces investment".

### Vague Allegation (Slop Signal)

A statement that _sounds_ factual but can neither be verified nor refuted:

- "Studies show" / "Research suggests" → which studies?
- "Experts say" → who?
- "Many companies" → how many?
- "It is well known that" → source?
- "Throughout history" → since when exactly?

### Probable Hallucination

An allegation presenting markers of fabrication:

- Strangely round number ("80% of businesses") without a source.
- Attribution to a vague institution ("according to specialists").
- Precise statistics that do not match any known database.

## Verification Grid (Systematic Questions)

For each detected allegation, apply the **WWWW H** grid:

- **Who** produced this data?
- **When** was it measured?
- **What** was the exact number?
- **Where** (which geographic/sectoral scope)?
- **How** (methodology, sample size)?

## Credible Sourcing Models

### Good Sourcing

- "According to the 2023 Federal Reserve annual report (p. 42)..."
- "A study by Smith et al. (2022, Nature) showed that..."
- "Data from the BLS (Employment Situation, Q3 2024) indicates that..."

### Bad Sourcing (Flag this)

- "Studies show that..."
- "As many experts have pointed out..."
- "It is widely recognized that..."
- "A recent report revealed..." (which report?)
