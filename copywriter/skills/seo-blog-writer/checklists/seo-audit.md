# SEO Audit Checklist (The Definition of Done)

Do not publish until all items are checked.

## 1. Technical SEO

- [ ] **Slug**: Is it clean? (e.g., `/value-based-pricing` not `/how-to-price-value-2024`)
- [ ] **Title Tag**: Does it start with the keyword? Is it < 60 chars?
- [ ] **Meta Description**: Is it < 160 chars? Does it include the keyword and a benefit?
- [ ] **Images**: Do all images have Alt Text describing the visual + keyword?

## 2. On-Page SEO

- [ ] **Keyword Density**: Is the primary keyword in the H1, first 100 words, and last 100 words?
- [ ] **Header Hierarchy**: Are H2s and H3s nested correctly?
- [ ] **Internal Links**: Are there 3+ links to other [copywriter] posts?
- [ ] **External Links**: Are there 2+ links to high-authority sites (Wikipedia, Forbes, Industry Studies)?

## 3. Engagement (E-E-A-T)

- [ ] **The "I" Check**: Did you use the word "I" to share a personal experience? (Demonstrates Experience).
- [ ] **Formatting**: Is there a bulleted list or bolded text every 300 words? (Scannability).
- [ ] **Rich Media**: Is there a video embed or infographic placeholder?

## 4. Conversion

- [ ] **CTA Alignment**: Does the CTA match the search intent? (Don't sell a $5k service on a beginner post).
- [ ] **Above the Fold**: Is the answer visible without scrolling?
