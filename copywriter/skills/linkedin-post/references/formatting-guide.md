# LinkedIn Formatting Guide: Whitespace & Dwell Time

Formatting on LinkedIn is not about "Aesthetics"—it is about **Algorithm Optimization**. This guide teaches you how to structure your posts for maximum scannability and "Dwell Time." Every space you add is a signal to the algorithm that your content is worth reading.

## 🏛 1. The Mobile-First Scannability Law

Over 80% of LinkedIn users are on mobile. A dense paragraph that looks fine on a desktop is a "Wall of Text" on a phone.

### The Rule of Two:

Never have more than two lines of text in a single paragraph.

- **Line 1**: The Hook/Intro.
- **Line 2**: The Context.
- **(Blank Line)**: The "Breather."

## 🧬 2. Whitespace Engineering (Algorithmic Logic)

LinkedIn measures "Dwell Time"—the amount of time a user spends looking at your post. Whitespace forces the user to flick their thumb more often, which increases the time spent on the asset.

### Proper Spacing Patterns:

- **Phase 1 (The Setup)**: Short, punchy lines.
- **Phase 2 (The Meat)**: Bullet points or slightly longer (2-line) blocks.
- **Phase 3 (The CTA)**: Isolated, high-contrast links or questions.

## 🧬 3. Visual Anchors (Emojis & Symbols)

Emojis should be used as "Signs," not as "Decorations."

| Symbol | Meaning        | Solo Usage                     |
| :----- | :------------- | :----------------------------- |
| •      | Primary Bullet | For lists and checklists.      |
| 🚀     | Result/Win     | To highlight a metric.         |
| 💡     | Aha! Moment    | To highlight a key lesson.     |
| ✅     | Done/Success   | For "Before/After" lists.      |
| ⚠️     | Warning        | To highlight a common mistake. |
| →      | Direction      | To point toward a CTA or link. |

## 🧪 4. The "No-Slop" Writing Protocol

AI-generated content often uses "Bridge Sentences" that add zero value. Formatting helps you identify and kill them.

### What to Cut:

- "It is important to remember that..."
- "In conclusion, we can see..."
- "Let's delve deeper into..."
- "Furthermore, it is worth noting..."

### Use "Knowledge Nuggets" Instead:

Instead of a long paragraph explaining a concept, use a **Framework Block**:

> **The 3-Step Protocol:**
>
> 1. [Action A]
> 2. [Action B]
> 3. [Result C]

## ⚒ 5. Technical Formatting Shortcuts

| Effect          | How to do it            | Solo Usage               |
| :-------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Bold**        | Use Unicode Generator   | For Hooks and Key Words. |
| **Itallic**     | Use Unicode Generator   | For personal side-notes. |
| **Spacing**     | Double [Enter]          | To create the "Gap."     |
| **Line breaks** | Special invisible space | For long "Story" breaks. |

## 🧪 6. The "Dwell-Time" Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Is the Hook visible above the "See More"?**
- [ ] **Are there at least 10 blank lines in the post?**
- [ ] **Are bullet points used for all lists?**
- [ ] **Is the CTA isolated on its own line?**
- [ ] **Did you remove all 3+ line paragraphs?**
- [ ] **Is the first sentence of the body a "Micro-Hook"?**

---

## 🎨 7. Post Logic Hierarchy

1.  **Level 1: The Hook** (Psychological capture).
2.  **Level 2: The Tension** (Building the problem).
3.  **Level 3: The Framework** (Educational value).
4.  **Level 4: The Proof** (Experience markers).
5.  **Level 5: The Reflection** (Personal voice).
6.  **Level 6: The CTA** (Conversion signal).

---

## 📈 8. Advanced Alignment (Voice DNA)

Formatting should match your `voice-dna.json`.

- **Direct Voice**: Uses single-line "Punchy" formatting.
- **Educational Voice**: Uses structured bullet-point "Lessons."
- **Storyteller Voice**: Uses more whitespace between narrative acts.
