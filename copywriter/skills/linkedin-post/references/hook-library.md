# The LinkedIn Hook Library: 30+ Scroll-Stop Formulas

The "Hook" is the first 1-2 lines of your LinkedIn post. It determines whether a user clicks "See More" or continues scrolling. This vault provides the psychological blueprints for hooks that drive "Dwell Time" and engagement.

## 🏛 1. The 3 Laws of the LinkedIn Hook

1.  **The "See More" Gap**: The first 140 characters must create a narrative gap that can only be filled by clicking the expand button.
2.  **The No-Fluff Rule**: No "I'm excited to share..." or "In today's landscape..." Start mid-action.
3.  **The Formatting Rule**: Use a maximum of 2 lines before a blank line to ensure the hook sits above the fold.

## 🧪 5. The Active Post-Audit

Before you post, check your hook against these 5 filters:

- [ ] **Character Count**: Is the "meat" visible before the 140th character?
- [ ] **Curiosity Gap**: Does it ask a question the user _must_ know the answer to?
- [ ] **First-Person**: Does it use "I" or "My" to signal experience? (Ref: `voice-dna.json`)
- [ ] **Audience Match**: Does it use the specific jargon from `icp.json`?
- [ ] **AntiSlop**: Is it free of "leverage," "impactful," and "synergy"?
