# Newsletter Anatomy Reference

## The 5-Part Email Structure

### 1. The Envelope (Subject + Preview)

- **Subject**: The headline. Must invoke curiosity or benefit.
- **Preview Text**: The second headline. Visible in inbox.
- _Rule_: Never repeat the subject in the preview. Use them together.
  - Subj: "I messed up."
  - Prev: "Here is what I learned from losing $10k."

### 2. The Salutation & Lede

- **Greeting**: "Hey [Name]," (Personalization matters).
- **The Lede**: First sentence must be short. Punchy. Get them reading.
  - _Bad_: "Welcome to edition 45 of the newsletter where we discuss..."
  - _Good_: "I didn't think I would send this email."

### 3. The Body (The Value)

- **One Big Idea**: Don't cram 5 topics.
- **Scannability**: Use bolding, bullet points, and short paragraphs.
- **The Turn**: Pivot from "Story" to "Lesson".

### 4. The CTA (The Ask)

- **Super Signature**:
  "When you are ready, here are 3 ways I can help:
  1. Course A
  2. Course B
  3. Consult"
- **Button**: Clear, action-oriented text. "Read the full story".

### 5. The P.S. (The Retention Hack)

- People read the P.S. first.
- Use it to: re-state the offer, drop a secondary link, or ask a question.
- "P.S. Hit reply and tell me your favorite ice cream." (Boosts sender reputation).
