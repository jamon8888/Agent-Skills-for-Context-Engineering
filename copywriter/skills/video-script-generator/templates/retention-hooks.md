# Retention Hooks (The Watch Time Boosters)

Use these patterns to stop viewers from clicking away.

## 1. The "Open Loop" (Curiosity)

_Concept: Open a question in the viewer's mind that you don't answer immediately._

- "I'm going to show you the best setting for this camera, but first, we need to fix the lighting."
- "There is one huge mistake most people make. I'll get to that in a minute."
- "You might be wondering why I am holding a sledgehammer."

## 2. The "Pattern Interrupt" (Attention Reset)

_Concept: Change the visual or audio stimulus abruptly every 30-60 seconds._

- **Visual**: Cut to black for 0.5s.
- **Audio**: Sound effect (Record scratch, Pop, Whoosh).
- **Environment**: Change location (Office -> Outside).
- **Format**: Text overlay takes over the screen.

## 3. The "Frame Stack" (Pacing)

_Concept: Layer information density._

- **Level 1**: Talking head (Low density).
- **Level 2**: B-Roll footage (Medium density).
- **Level 3**: Text + Graphics over B-Roll (High density).
  _Rule: Never stay on Level 1 for more than 10 seconds._

## 4. The "J-Cut" (Smooth Transition)

_Concept: Audio from the next scene starts before the video cuts._

- _Hear_: "And that leads us to the battery test..." (While still seeing the previous scene).
- _See_: Cut to battery test.
