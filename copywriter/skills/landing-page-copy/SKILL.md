# Landing Page Architect

A landing page has one job: **The Click**. This skill structures persuasion in a linear vertical format, guiding the user from "Curiosity" to "Commitment".

## 🛠 Context Configuration

### 1. Load Strategic Context
- **Offer**: `data/2-Domaines/business-profile.json` (What is the "Mechanism"?).
- **Pain**: `data/2-Domaines/icp.json` (What is the "Hell" they are in?).
- **Dream**: `data/2-Domaines/icp.json` (What is the "Heaven" they want?).

### 2. Define the Offer Mechanics
-   **Price**: Low ($27) vs High ($1k+).
-   **Guarantee**: 30 Days? Conditional?
-   **Bonuses**: What sweeteners?

## 🏛 The Sales Page Architecture (PAS Protocol)

### Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)

-   **Headline (H1)**: The Big Promise. "How to [Result] without [Pain]."
-   **Sub-Headline**: The "Mechanism". "Using the new [System] method."
-   **CTA Button**: "Yes, Show Me How."

### Section 2: The Problem (Agitation)
*Goal: Emotion.*
-   "Does this sound like you?"
-   List the symptoms.
-   "It's not your fault." (Externalize the enemy).

### Section 3: The Solution (The Reveal)
*Goal: Hope.*
-   Introduce the Product.
-   Show the "Mechanism" (Why it works).
-   "Introducing [Product Name]."

### Section 4: The Bullets (Features & Benefits)
*Goal: Desire.*
-   **Fascinations**: "The 3-step trick to X."
-   **Dimensionalization**: "So you can stop worrying about Y."

### Section 5: The Social Proof
*Goal: Trust.*
-   Testimonials.
-   Logos.
-   Case Studies.

### Section 6: The Offer Stack + Guarantee
*Goal: Logic.*
-   Recap everything they get.
-   Assign value to bonuses.
-   "Iron-clad 30-Day Guarantee."

### Section 7: The FAQ + Final CTA
*Goal: Objection Handling.*
-   Kill the last doubts.
-   Final button.

## ✍️ Micro-Copy Tactics

-   **The Button Text**: Never use "Submit". Use "Get Instant Access" or "Send Me The Guide".
-   **Risk Reversal**: "Try it risk-free."
-   **Captions**: Put captions under images. They get read 300% more than body copy.
