# Content Calendar Strategy Reference

## The Cascade Repurposing Architecture

One core idea becomes many assets using the Waterfall/Cascade method.

### Level 1: The Core Pillar (Hero Asset)

- **Format**: Long-form Blog Post or Newsletter.
- **Goal**: Deep authority, SEO ranking, detailed explanation.
- **Frequency**: 1x per week.

### Level 2: The Social Splinter (LinkedIn/Twitter)

- **Format**: Thread, Carousel, or Long-form schematic.
- **Goal**: Reach, engagement, traffic back to Hero.
- **Content**: Extract the "How-to", the "Contrarian Take", or the "List" from the Hero.
- **Frequency**: 3-5x per week.

### Level 3: The Short-Form Signal (Notes/Shorts)

- **Format**: Substack Note, Tweet, Reel script.
- **Goal**: Awareness, reminders, quick tips.
- **Frequency**: Daily / Ad-hoc.

## Monthly Calendar Structure

### Step 1: Monthly Theme

Assign a "Theme of the Month" to create focus.
_Example: "Q1 is about 'Automation'. All content leads to the Automation Course."_

### Step 2: Weekly Sprints

Break the month into 4 weeks, each with a specific angle on the theme.

- **Week 1**: The Problem (Why the status quo is painful).
- **Week 2**: The Mindset (New way of thinking).
- **Week 3**: The Method (How to actually do it).
- **Week 4**: The Offer (Join the course / book a call).

### Step 3: Daily Slotting (The Grid)

| Day     | Platform   | Format    | Topic/Hook                 | Repurposing Source |
| :------ | :--------- | :-------- | :------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Mon** | LinkedIn   | Text Post | "Why I stopped doing X"    | Week 1 Hero        |
| **Tue** | Newsletter | Email     | "The Automation Manifesto" | **NEW HERO**       |
| **Wed** | LinkedIn   | Carousel  | "5 Steps to Automate X"    | Tue Newsletter     |
| **Thu** | Twitter    | Thread    | "My full tech stack"       | Tue Newsletter     |
| **Fri** | LinkedIn   | Personal  | "My biggest failure..."    | _Standalone_       |

## Strategic Tips

1. **Batching**: Write all "Heroes" on Monday, all "Splinters" on Tuesday.
2. **Flexibility**: Leave Friday open for "Newsjacking" (reacting to industry news).
3. **Analytics Loop**: Check `linkedin-analytics` before planning next month to see what worked.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **"Random Acts of Content"**: Posting without a theme → Enforce the monthly Theme.
- **"Promotion Heavy"**: Asking too often → Enforce the 10% Sales rule.
- **"Platform Silo"**: Creating unique content for every platform → Enforce Repurposing via Cascade.
