## Notes (beyond the formal score)

Sarah was clear on the problem but genuinely uncertain on the solution landscape — she hasn't evaluated anything yet and doesn't have a clear timeline. The CTO sign-off may add 2–3 weeks. Decision Readiness score (63%) understates the real friction — she answered "already aware and supportive" for the stakeholder question, but her comment reveals the CTO hasn't been in the solution-evaluation conversation yet.

The score puts her at High band (74/100), which maps to Proposal stage. Recommend proceeding with a proposal but framing it as a co-evaluation with the CTO — not a direct pitch to Sarah alone.
