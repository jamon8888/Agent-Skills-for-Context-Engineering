# Retainer Types Guide

Four models for structuring retainer relationships. Choose based on the nature of the work and the client's predictability.

---

## Model 1: Hours Retainer ("Time Bank")

**Structure:** Client purchases X hours per month. Unused hours don't roll over (or roll over with a cap of 1 month).

**Best for:**
- Development, design, writing — where work is measured in time
- Clients who need varying work from month to month
- When deliverables can't be pre-defined

**Pricing:**
- Set at a discount vs. standard hourly rate (typically 10–15% off)
- The client pays for access and priority, not just hours
- Example: Standard rate €120/h → Retainer rate €100/h for 10h/month = €1,000/month

**Pros:**
- Simple to track and invoice
- Flexible for client
- Easy to discuss scope creep (overtime is billed at standard rate)

**Cons:**
- Under-usage problem: if client only uses 6 of 10 hours, they question value
- You're still trading time for money (no leverage)

**Non-rollover clause:**
> "Unused hours don't roll over. If you find you're consistently using less than 10 hours, we can adjust the retainer down. If you're regularly going over, we can adjust up."

## Model 2: Deliverables Retainer ("Subscription Service")

**Structure:** Client receives a defined set of deliverables each month for a fixed fee.

**Best for:**
- Content creation (3 blog posts/month, 8 social posts/month)
- Reporting (weekly analytics report, monthly dashboard)
- Maintenance (monthly security updates, weekly performance checks)
- Anything repeatable and measurable

**Pricing:**
- Price the package, not the hours
- Add a 15–20% premium vs. project rate (reliability premium)
- Example: 4 LinkedIn posts + 1 newsletter = €1,200/month

**Pros:**
- Client knows exactly what they're getting
- You know exactly what to deliver (no scope uncertainty)
- Scalable: you become faster over time → margin improves

**Cons:**
- Rigid: client needs may vary month to month
- Requires clear delivery process to avoid debates about "counts as one post?"
- If you go faster, you earn more per hour; if slower, margin suffers

**Scope definition is critical:**
- Name each deliverable precisely (word count, format, number of revisions, approval process)
- Define what happens if client doesn't provide inputs by [date]: deliverable is deferred to next month

## Model 3: Advisory Retainer ("On-Call Expert")

**Structure:** Client buys availability and access, not a specific output. You're available for questions, reviews, and decisions throughout the month.

**Best for:**
- Consultants, coaches, strategists
- Fractional executive roles (Fractional CMO, CTO-as-a-service)
- Clients who need occasional expert input on decisions, not regular deliverables

**Pricing:**
- Premium pricing: this is the highest-value model
- Not sold by hour — sold by availability
- "You have access to my expertise when you need it"
- Example: Up to 4 async/sync touchpoints per month + up to 2h advisory calls = €2,500/month

**Pros:**
- Highest effective hourly rate (many months they barely use it)
- Builds deep strategic relationship
- Positions you as a trusted advisor, not a vendor
- Low delivery overhead (no "production" work)

**Cons:**
- Hard to justify if client doesn't proactively reach out
- Risk of being ignored → non-renewal despite delivering value
- Requires proving value through proactive insights, not just reacting to requests

**The proactive move:** Send one unprompted, valuable insight or observation per month even if the client hasn't reached out. This demonstrates you're thinking about them even when they don't ask.

## Model 4: Outcome Retainer ("Success Partnership")

**Structure:** Base fee + performance component tied to an agreed metric.

**Best for:**
- Marketing (base fee + % of attributed revenue)
- Sales coaching (base fee + % of quota improvement)
- Lead generation (base fee + cost per qualified lead)
- Any role where outcomes can be credibly measured

**Pricing:**
- Base fee: covers your time/deliverables
- Performance component: upside if you deliver results
- Example: €1,500/month base + €50 per qualified lead delivered

**Pros:**
- Aligns your incentives with the client's
- Can generate significantly higher income than pure time-based models
- Signals confidence in your work

**Cons:**
- Requires clear, unambiguous measurement of the outcome
- Risk of factors outside your control affecting the metric
- Client may claim your work didn't drive the outcome

**Essential protections:**
- Define the metric precisely (what counts as "qualified lead"?)
- Define your control (you're accountable for outputs, not outcomes if inputs depend on client)
- Set a base fee that covers your time even in a bad month

## Choosing the Right Model

| If... | Use |
|-------|-----|
| Work varies month to month | Hours Retainer |
| Work is consistent and repeatable | Deliverables Retainer |
| Client needs judgment more than production | Advisory Retainer |
| You can credibly tie work to measurable outcomes | Outcome Retainer |
| Client is skeptical of retainers | Start with Deliverables (most tangible) |
| You want maximum leverage | Advisory or Outcome |

## The Retainer Ladder

For clients who resist retainers, use the ladder:

1. **First engagement:** Project (low risk, they see your work)
2. **Second engagement:** Another project (pattern established)
3. **Third engagement:** "We've now done X together. A retainer would make this simpler and give you priority access."

The third engagement is the natural retainer conversation moment. By then:
- Trust is established
- Ongoing need is demonstrated
- The client has experienced the friction of project-by-project contracting
- A retainer proposal feels like a service improvement, not a sales pitch
