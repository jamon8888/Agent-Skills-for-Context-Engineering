# Proto-Persona Validation Guide

A proto-persona is a guess. You must validate it or kill it.

## 1. The Validation Matrix

| Method                    | Strong Signal                                                           | Weak Signal                                            |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Discovery Interview**   | Person says "That is exactly how my day feels."                         | Person says "I suppose some people have that problem." |
| **Landing Page Test**     | >10% Conversion from this specific target.                              | High traffic, zero signups.                            |
| **Community Observation** | You find 3+ Reddit threads where people use the persona's exact jargon. | Jargon feels "Corporate" and artificial.               |

## 2. The "Refresh" Rule

- Update your `persona.json` after every 5 interviews.
- If the "Pain Points" change, the `positioning-statement.md` MUST also be updated.
