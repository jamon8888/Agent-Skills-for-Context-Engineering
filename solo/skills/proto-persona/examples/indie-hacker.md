---

## 🎭 Profile

- **Experience**: Mid-to-senior Fullstack Dev.

## 💡 Pain Points

- Time is his scarcest resource. Every hour spent on admin is an hour NOT spent building features.
- "Context Slop": His browser has 50 tabs open (Slack, Stripe, Twitter, GitHub, Notion).

## 🚀 How Solo Plugin Helps

- **Command**: `/solo:start` helps him switch from "Builder Mode" to "Leader Mode" in seconds.
- **Outcome**: He ships his MVP 2 weeks faster by automating the PRD and Story Mapping phase.
