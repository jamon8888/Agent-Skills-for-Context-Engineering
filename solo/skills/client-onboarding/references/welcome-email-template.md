Hi [First Name],

I'm genuinely excited to get started on [project description]. After our conversations, I have a clear picture of what you're trying to achieve, and I'm confident we're going to get there.

Here's what our next few days look like:

**Today:** I'm setting up our working environment and reviewing everything from our discovery call.

**By [date]:** I'll have [first concrete deliverable] ready for your review.

**Ongoing:** [Describe working cadence — e.g., "We'll meet every two weeks and you'll receive updates every Friday."]

---

**A few things I'll need from you to get started:**

1. [Specific input 1 — e.g., "Access to your Google Analytics account"]
2. [Specific input 2 — e.g., "Your existing brand guidelines or any designs you want to keep"]
3. [Specific input 3 — e.g., "Written approval on the project brief I'll send by [date]"]

If you can send these by **[date]**, I can stay on schedule and deliver [milestone] on time.

---

**How we'll work together:**

- **Day-to-day:** [Communication channel, e.g., "Email for longer updates, Slack for quick questions"]
- **Response time:** [e.g., "I reply within 24 hours on working days. For urgent matters: [phone/urgent channel]"]
- **Feedback:** [e.g., "I'll use [tool] for deliverable review so feedback is easy to track"]
- **Meetings:** [e.g., "We have a standing call every [day] at [time], plus I'll flag you if I need a quick decision"]

I've attached / linked:
- [x] Signed contract (for your records)
- [x] Project timeline overview
- [x] "Working With Me" guide (how I work, what I expect, what you can expect)

One last thing: the best projects I've worked on have been the ones where the client and I communicate openly and early when something isn't working. If anything ever feels off — the direction, the pace, my communication style — please tell me. I'd much rather adjust course at day 5 than discover a problem at day 50.

Looking forward to it.

*P.S. [Optional personal note — a detail from discovery that shows you were listening. E.g., "Your target to launch before [event] is top of mind — I've built the timeline around that date."]*

---

**Customization notes:**
- Replace all `[brackets]` with specifics before sending
- The P.S. line is optional but high-impact — use it when you have a genuine personal connection to reference
- Adjust tone to match your voice-dna.json — this template reads professional/warm; lean it toward your natural style
- French version: use "Bonjour" not "Hi", vouvoiement for B2B, adjust the emoji use (some clients find it unprofessional)
