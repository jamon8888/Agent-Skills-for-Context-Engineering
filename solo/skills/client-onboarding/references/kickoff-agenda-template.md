# Kickoff Call Agenda Template

**Duration:** 30–45 minutes
**When:** Day 1–3 after contract signing
**Format:** Video call (Zoom, Meet, Teams) or phone

---

## Pre-Call Prep (10 minutes, you only)

Before the call, review:
- [ ] The signed contract / proposal — know the scope cold
- [ ] Your discovery call notes — what did they say mattered most?
- [ ] The client's website, LinkedIn, recent news — anything changed?
- [ ] Your open questions — what's ambiguous in the scope?
- [ ] Blockers — what do you absolutely need from them to start?

**Set the agenda in the calendar invite so they come prepared:**
> "We'll spend 45 minutes covering: project goals, scope confirmation, working norms, first milestone, and anything you need from me. Please bring any questions you have about how we'll work together."

---

## Agenda

### 1. Realign on the Goal (5 minutes)

Don't assume they remember why they hired you. Reconnect to the real outcome.

**Your questions:**
- "Before we dive into the project, I'd love to revisit the big picture: what does success look like for you in 6 months if this goes really well?"
- "Is there anything that's changed since we last spoke that I should know about?"

**What you're listening for:**
- Any shift in priority since the proposal was signed
- Emotional investment (what are they actually afraid of? excited about?)
- Stakeholders they haven't mentioned who might have opinions

**What to capture:** Update the "Project Goal" field in the project README.

---

### 2. Scope Confirmation (10 minutes)

Walk through the proposal together. Make it real.

**Script:**
> "I want to walk through the scope together so we both leave this call with the same picture in our heads. I'll name what we agreed to build, and you can stop me if anything isn't right."

**Review:**
- Each deliverable (name it and describe it in plain language)
- The explicit "not in scope" items
- What you'll deliver vs. what you'll need from them

**The critical question:**
> "Is there anything on this list that means something different to you than what I just described?"

**Common misalignments to find now:**
- "Design" to them = mockups + live code; to you = mockups only
- "Launch" to them = SEO-optimized and on Google; to you = live URL
- "Strategy" to them = an implementation plan; to you = a written document

**What to capture:** Any clarifications → update project README and send in kickoff summary.

---

### 3. Deliverable Definitions (10 minutes)

Make each deliverable concrete and measurable.

**For each deliverable:**
- Format: What will they receive? (PDF, Figma link, live URL, Google Doc)
- Length / size: How many pages, screens, or items?
- Revision rounds: How many rounds of feedback are included?
- Approval process: Who signs off? Is there anyone else whose approval is needed?

**Use the "done when" test:**
> "When I send you [Deliverable 1], what would have to be true for you to say 'yes, this is done'?"

This often surfaces hidden expectations before they become disputes.

**What to capture:** Document the "done when" criteria in the project README.

---

### 4. Communication Norms (5 minutes)

This is the most underrated 5 minutes of onboarding.

**Establish:**

| Topic | Discuss | Document |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Primary channel | "Where should I send day-to-day messages?" | Client card |
| Response time | "What response time should we each expect?" | Client card |
| Feedback format | "When I send a deliverable, what's the easiest way for you to review it?" | Project file |
| Meeting cadence | "Do you want a standing weekly update call, or ad-hoc?" | Calendar |
| Urgent situations | "If something is time-sensitive, what's the fastest way to reach you?" | Client card |
| Change requests | "If anything changes in scope, we'll use a formal change request — is that okay?" | Contract |

**The tone question** (optional but valuable):
> "How direct do you want me to be if I think something isn't working? I prefer to say it early and often rather than let problems build."

---

### 5. Risk Identification (5 minutes)

Ask about what could go wrong before it does.

**Your questions:**
- "What could slow this project down from your side?" (Content delivery delays, approval bottlenecks, shifting priorities, budget sign-off)
- "Is there anyone else who will need to review or approve deliverables? When should I involve them?"
- "Are there any hard constraints I should know about? Events, company deadlines, blackout periods?"

**What to capture:** Log all risks in the project README under "Risks & Dependencies."

---

### 6. First Milestone Confirmation (5 minutes)

End the call by making the next 2 weeks concrete.

**Confirm:**
- First deliverable: [what exactly]
- Delivery date: [specific date, not "in 2 weeks"]
- What you need from them by [date] to make that happen
- When you'll next speak (or how they'll know you're working)

**Closing script:**
> "So just to confirm: you'll send me [inputs] by [date], and I'll have [first deliverable] to you by [date]. I'll send a written summary of everything we discussed today within 24 hours. Any questions before we close?"

---

## Post-Call (within 24 hours)

1. Update client card with any new information
2. Update project README with confirmed scope and milestones
3. Send kickoff summary (use kickoff summary template from `client-onboarding` SKILL.md)
4. Create onboarding checklist in project folder
5. Calendar the Week 2 check-in

## Warning Signs During Kickoff

Flag these for extra attention:

| Signal | What It Means | What to Do |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| They can't name a success metric | Unclear expectations; opinion-driven feedback ahead | Push to define 1–2 measurable outcomes |
| Approval needs 3+ people | Long feedback loops, risk of conflicting feedback | Get a named decision-maker |
| "We might need to add X later" | Scope creep is already planned | Address explicitly: "That would be a change request" |
| Unreachable during project | Communication bottleneck | Set hard deadlines for their inputs |
| "You're the expert, you decide" | Sounds great, often isn't — means zero engagement until launch | Schedule mandatory check-ins at key milestones |
