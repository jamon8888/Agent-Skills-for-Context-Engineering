# The Differentiator Lab

Finding your "Only." If you don't have a differentiator, you have a commodity.

## 1. The Differentiation Matrix

| Type               | Strategy                      | Example                                 |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Niche**          | Narrow target, specific pain. | "The only CRM for Urban Goat Farmers."  |
| **Method**         | A unique, branded process.    | "The 7-Step 'Sprint to Cash' Workflow." |
| **Business Model** | Changing how users pay.       | "Price per result, not per hour."       |
| **Performance**    | Being 10x faster or better.   | "Zero-latency video rendering."         |

## 2. The "Only" Benchmark

Test your differentiated statement with this formula:

> **"Our brand is the ONLY [Category] that [Unique Differentiator] for [Target Segment] in a world of [Standard Alternative]."**

## 3. The Litmus Test

- **Is it true?** (Can you proof it?)
- **Is it rare?** (Does everyone else claim it too?)
- **Is it valuable?** (Does the user actually care?)
- **Is it defensible?** (How hard is it for a competitor to copy tomorrow?)
