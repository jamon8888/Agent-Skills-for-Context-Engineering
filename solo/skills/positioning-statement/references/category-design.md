# Category Design: Moving from "One of Many" to "Only"

Positioning is not about being "Better." It is about being **Different**. This guide uses the principles of Al Ries, Jack Trout, and Christopher Lochhead to frame your solo business in a category you can own.

## 1. The Hierarchy of Value

1.  **Commodity**: "I write code." (Price is determined by the market).
2.  **Specialist**: "I build Shopify apps." (Price is higher, but still competitive).
3.  **Category King**: "I build _Conversion-First_ Checkout Engines for Luxury Skincare." (Price is irrelevant; you are the **Only**).

## 2. The "3-Circle" Category Audit

To find your category, find the intersection of these three circles:

- **Circle 1: Unique Mechanism**: A specific way of working that only you use (e.g., "AI-Native Context Engineering").
- **Circle 2: Specific Audience**: A persona with a high-pain problem (Ref: `icp.json`).
- **Circle 3: The Enemy**: A status quo that you are fighting against (e.g., "The billable hour," "Vague marketing fluff").

## 3. Creating the "POV" (Point of View)

A Category King is defined by their Point of View. Your POV should make people say: "I never thought of it that way before."

### The POV Formula:

> "In the [Category] market, most people believe [Common Myth]. But the reality is [The Insight]. That’s why we built [Product/Service], specifically for [Audience] who wants to [Benefit]."

**Example (Solo OS)**:
"In the productivity market, most people believe more tools = more output. But the reality is tool-overload kills strategic focus. That's why we built the Solo OS, specifically for solopreneurs who want to automate the admin and master the craft."

## 4. The "Checkmate" Positioning Framework (April Dunford)

| Component                    | Professional Standard                                                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Competitive Alternatives** | What would they do if you didn't exist? (Be honest: usually "Excel" or "Do it manually"). |
| **Unique Attributes**        | What do you have that they don't? (Ref: `voice-dna`, `para-system`).                      |
| **Value (Result)**           | What is the financial or emotional outcome? (Ref: `outcomes-guide.md`).                   |
| **Market Category**          | What "Shelf" in the customer's mind do you belong on?                                     |

## 5. Implementation in the OS

1.  **Draft**: Use the `positioning-statement` skill to generate 3 POV variations.
2.  **Audit**: Run the "So What?" test. If a competitor can claim your POV, rewrite it.
3.  **Deploy**: Update your `positioning.md` and use it as the "System Prompt" for all content generation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A category is not found; it is **designed**. Use the [Positioning Workbook](./workbook.md) to facilitate a 60-minute session with the AI.
