# Positioning Example: The Solo Plugin

- **Target**: High-output solopreneurs (designers, devs, marketers).
- **Pain**: Context switches and "Admin Slop" killing deep work.
- **Category**: AI-Native Operating System.
- **Differentiator**: "No-Code" local data layer that lives in your OS, not a browser tab.

## Final Statement (Moore Framework)

For **high-output solopreneurs** who are **buried in administrative slop**, the **Solo Plugin** is an **AI-Native Operating System** that **automates the entire business lifecycle from strategy to invoice**. Unlike **generic AI assistants** or **fragmented SaaS tools**, our product **links your domain knowledge directly to your local file system for zero-friction execution**.
