# Remediation Rules — Before/After Examples (EN)

## Rule 1: Vague → Concrete

### Principle

Every empty word must be replaced by a concrete mechanism, a metric, or an example.

### Examples

**Before:**

> Our innovative solution optimizes processes to create value-added outcomes for stakeholders.

**After:**

> Our tool reduces invoice processing from 4 days to 6 hours by automating data extraction via OCR. Finance teams spend this saved time managing exceptions rather than manual entry.

**Before:**

> We help organizations navigate their digital transformation.

**After:**

> We train sales teams on Salesforce (3-day onboarding program) and digitize paper records to SharePoint, averaging 15,000 documents per mission.

## Rule 2: Superlative → Consequence

### Principle

Words like "crucial", "essential", "vital" are unsupported value judgments. Replace them with the measurable consequence of their absence.

### Examples

**Before:**

> It is crucial to invest in cybersecurity.

**After:**

> A fluid SMB hit by ransomware loses on average $130,000 and 21 business days (IBM Report 2023). An annual security audit costs between $5,000 and $15,000.

**Before:**

> Continuous training is essential to remain competitive.

**After:**

> Sales reps trained twice a year on the new CRM close 18% more deals than those trained only once (internal data, Q2 2024).

## Rule 3: Broken Rhythm

### Principle

Inject short sentences (< 8 words) between long ones. Break sequences of 3+ sentences with similar word counts.

### Examples

**Before (Monotone rhythm):**

> Implementing a customer retention strategy requires a deep understanding of consumer expectations. This understanding stems from analyzing behavioral data and qualitative feedback. Companies that succeed in this approach are those that integrate this information into their decision-making process.

**After (Varied rhythm):**

> Retaining a customer costs five times less than acquiring a new one. But you have to know what they actually want. Purchase data reveals habits, not frustrations. To find those, read support tickets. Decathlon gets it: since 2022, every product manager reads 50 customer reviews week.

## Rule 4: English Typography

See `./references/typography_en.md` for the full reference.

## Rule 5: 1 Paragraph = 1 Idea

### Principle

A paragraph longer than 6 lines (or ~120 words) must be split. Every paragraph should be classifiable by a single sentence summary.

### Test

If you cannot write "This paragraph says [X]" in one simple sentence, it contains too many ideas.

---

## Rule 6: Mechanical Connectors → Deletion

### Principle

"Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally" are filler connectors. Delete them and check if the text still makes sense. If yes, the connector was useless.

### Example

**Before:**

> Additionally, it is worth noting that the human dimension is at the heart of our approach. Moreover, we pride ourselves on supporting our collaborators in their development journey.

**After:**

> Every new hire gets a dedicated mentor for their first 90 days.

---

## Rule 7: Moral Conclusion → Concrete Implication

### Principle

Delete any conclusion starting with "it is essential to", "in conclusion", "as we move forward". Replace with an actionable next step or a measurable implication.

### Example

**Before:**

> In conclusion, it is essential to place humans at the center of digital transformation to succeed in today's ever-evolving landscape.

**After:**

> Next step: Audit the 3 most time-consuming processes in the accounting department by the end of March. Estimated budget: $12,000.
