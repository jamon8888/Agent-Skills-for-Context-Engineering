# The Continuous Discovery Routine: Mastery Habit

Continuous Discovery is not a "One-Time Project." It is a weekly habit that keeps your `business-profile.json` aligned with reality. Follow this routine to ensure you never build something nobody wants.

## 1. The Weekly Beat Architecture

| Day           | Action               | Time | Output                                      |
| :------------ | :------------------- | :--: | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Monday**    | **Signal Scan**      | 30m  | Review Reddit/Forums for new pain points.   |
| **Wednesday** | **The Conversation** | 45m  | Conduct one 15-minute "Mom Test" interview. |
| **Friday**    | **The Synthesis**    | 30m  | Update the `ost.md` and `icp.json`.         |

## 2. Low-Friction Recruiting Strategies

As a solopreneur, you don't have a research department. Use these tactics:

- **The "No-Pitch" Nudge**: "I am researching [Category] for a new project and noticed your comment on [Platform]. Could I ask 3 specific questions about your workflow?"
- **The "Help a Peer" Angle**: "I'm a solo builder working on [Problem]. Would you be open to an 8-minute chat to help me avoid building something useless?"
- **The "Contextual Research" Invite**: "I noticed you're a heavy user of [Competitor]. What's the one thing that still frustrates you about it?"

## 3. The "Discovery-to-Development" Bridge

1.  **Discovery**: "Users hate manual data entry."
2.  **Hypothesis**: "If we add a `/solo:scan` command, time-to-value will drop."
3.  **Slicing**: Build the `walking-skeleton.md` for the scan.
4.  **Closing the loop**: Show the skeleton to the person you interviewed on Wednesday.

## 4. Measuring the Habit

- **Metric**: "Number of peer/client conversations per month."
- **Target**: 2 to 4.
- **Fail Signal**: Building for 30 days without talking to a human.
