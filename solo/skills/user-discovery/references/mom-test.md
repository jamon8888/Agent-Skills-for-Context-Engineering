Based on Rob Fitzpatrick's "The Mom Test," this guide teaches you how to ask questions that even your mom couldn't lie to you about. As a solopreneur, "False Positives" are the fastest way to go bankrupt.

## 1. The 3 Golden Rules

1.  **Talk about their life, not your idea**. The moment you mention your idea, people start being "nice."
2.  **Ask about specifics in the past, not opinions about the future**. "What would you pay?" is a lie. "How much did you spend on this last month?" is a fact.
3.  **Talk less and listen more**. Your goal is to extract data, not to pitch a feature.

## 2. Converting Weak Questions to "Mom Test" Questions

| The Weak Question (Lies)                | The Mom Test Question (Truth)                                             |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Do you think this is a good idea?"     | "What is the hardest part about [X] today?"                               |
| "Would you pay $50 for this?"           | "How much are you spending currently to solve [X]?"                       |
| "What would your dream tool look like?" | "Tell me about the last time you tried to solve [X]. Walk me through it." |
| "Do you like the UI?"                   | "Which part of the current process takes the most clicks?"                |

## 3. The Signal Audit (How to know if you're winning)

### A "High-Signal" Interview includes:

- [ ] **Specific numbers**: "I spent $200 last week on [X]."
- [ ] **Emotional intensity**: "It drives me crazy when the software crashes."
- [ ] **Workarounds**: The client shows you a complex Excel sheet they built to solve your target problem.

### A "Low-Signal" Interview includes:

- [ ] **Flattery**: "That sounds great! I'd love to see it when it's done." -> **This is a failure.**
- [ ] **Hypotheticals**: "I think I might use that if it had [Feature]."
- [ ] **Generic Praise**: "You're so smart to build this."

## 4. Documentation Strategy

- **Extraction**: Immediately after the call, extract the "Hidden Needs" and add them to your `ost.md`.
- **Refinement**: Update your `icp.json` with the exact words (jargon) used by the client.
- **Verification**: Use the findings to invalidate hypotheses in your `lean-ux-canvas.md`.

> [!CAUTION]
> If 5 people in a row say "It's a great idea" but none of them can tell you a specific time they struggled with the problem, **pivot immediately**.
