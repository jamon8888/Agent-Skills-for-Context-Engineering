# High-Signal Interview Scripts: The Discovery Playbook

Use these scripts as a starting point for your `discovery-process` interviews. Remember: These are not rigid forms, but conversational guides to lead you to the **Truth**.

## Script 1: The "Problem Explorer"

_Use this when you are in Phase 2 (Opportunities) of your OST._

- **Opening**: "Thanks for chatting. I'm trying to understand how [Persona Type] handles [Category] these days. Tell me, walk me through your current process."
- **The Pivot**: "You mentioned [X] was a bit annoying. Can you tell me more about that?"
- **The "Money" Question**: "What have you tried to solve this so far? Did you pay for any tools or services?"
- **Closing**: "Who else do you know who struggles with this? I’d love to talk to them too."

## Script 2: The "Solution Validated" (Post-Prototype)

_Use this after you've built a `figma-prototype` or `walking-skeleton`._

- **Opening**: "I've been working on a potential fix for the [Problem] we discussed. I'd love to get your honest reaction to a 1-minute demo."
- **The "Watch" Phase**: (Show the demo). **Stay silent.** Watch where they click.
- **The "Signal" Question**: "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to use this _exactly as it is_ tomorrow morning?"
- **The "Sacrifice" Test**: "If I gave you early access, would you be willing to write a 1-paragraph testimonial for me?" (If NO, they don't really like it).

## Script 3: The "Competitor Breakdown"

_Use this when performing `competitive-intelligence`._

- **Opening**: "I noticed you're a power user of [Competitor]. What made you sign up for them in the first place?"
- **The "Frustration" Nudge**: "What’s the one thing you still have to do manually even though you pay for [Competitor]?"
- **The "Switching Cost"**: "What would have to change for you to move your data to a more [Your Value Prop] system?"

## Scripting Best Practices

- **Mirroring**: "So, you find it 'clunky'?"
- **Labels**: "It sounds like you're worried about [Risk]."
- **The Silence**: Count to 5 after they stop talking. People often fill the silence with their most valuable insights.
