# Discovery Interview Methodology Guide

## 1. Research Goals

| Goal | What you're testing |
|------|---------------------|
| **Problem validation** | Does the pain exist? How intense? Does it affect enough people to be worth solving? |
| **Jobs-to-be-Done** | What is the customer trying to accomplish? What forces drive them to switch solutions? |
| **Churn investigation** | What specifically caused them to stop using the product or switch to a competitor? |
| **Prioritization** | Which problem matters most to them, so you build the right thing first? |

## 2. Recommended Methodologies

### The Mom Test
**Core rule:** Ask about past behaviors, never future intentions.

- ❌ "Would you use an app that…?" — People lie to be nice.
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time you dealt with this problem." — Past behavior is honest.

**Scoring a Mom Test interview:**
- Score +1 for each specific story with a date and context
- Score +1 for each revealed workaround or hack
- Score +1 for each verbatim quote that expresses frustration or desire
- Score 0 for opinions, compliments, or hypothetical agreements

### Jobs-to-be-Done (Switch Interview)
Maps the four forces driving a customer to change:
1. **Push** — What about their current situation frustrated them enough to look for something new?
2. **Pull** — What attracted them to the new solution?
3. **Anxiety** — What made them hesitate to switch?
4. **Habit** — What comfort kept them from switching sooner?

**Questions for a Switch interview:**
- "Tell me about the moment you decided to look for a new solution."
- "What were you using before? Why did you start looking for something else?"
- "What almost stopped you from making the switch?"
- "Was there a specific event that triggered the change?"

### Continuous Discovery Habit
Run 30-minute sessions weekly with target users. The goal is not a big research project — it is a sustained rhythm.

Setup:
1. Define a standing "research question" for the current product cycle
2. Recruit 1-2 participants per week from your user base or target ICP
3. Record (with consent) or take structured notes using the template below
4. Extract 3-5 opportunities per session, map to opportunity space

## 3. Biases to Avoid

| Bias | What it looks like | Fix |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| **Confirmation bias** | Steering the interview toward what you already believe | Write your assumptions before the interview and actively look for disconfirming evidence |
| **Leading questions** | "Don't you find it frustrating when X?" | Rephrase as: "How do you feel about X?" |
| **Hypothetical questions** | "Would you use a feature that…?" | Replace with: "Tell me about the last time you needed to do X." |
| **Recency bias** | Weighting the most recent interview over all data | Maintain a cross-session insight log |
| **Courtesy bias** | Interviewee being polite instead of honest | Explicitly tell them: "Honest critical feedback is more valuable to me than encouragement." |

## 4. Success Criteria

A session is successful if it produces:
- At least 2 specific past stories with dates and context
- At least 1 genuine surprise (something you did not expect)
- At least 3 verbatim quotes usable in a problem statement
- At least 1 revealed workaround or coping behavior
