2. **Ask follow-ups** — Dig deeper with "why?" and "how?"
3. **Capture exact words** — Use their language, not yours
4. **Be specific** — Push for concrete examples, not generalities
5. **Validate assumptions** — Ask "How do you know?" for claims
6. **Take notes** — Capture quotes and insights verbatim
