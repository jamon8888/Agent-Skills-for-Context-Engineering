## Subject Lines to AVOID

### ❌ Too Vague

- "Quick question" (about what?)
- "Following up" (on what?)
- "Collaboration opportunity" (too generic)

### ❌ Too Salesy

- "I can help you" (self-serving)
- "Increase your revenue by 300%" (unbelievable)
- "Limited time offer" (spammy)

### ❌ Too Long

- "I saw you're hiring a VP of Product and wanted to reach out about helping with design" (>60 characters, gets cut off on mobile)

### ❌ All Caps or Excessive Punctuation

- "URGENT: READ THIS NOW!!!" (spam filter trigger)
- "Quick question???" (unprofessional)

---

## Subject Line Best Practices

### Length

- **Ideal:** 30-50 characters
- **Max:** 60 characters (mobile truncates after 60)
- **Min:** 20 characters (too short feels incomplete)

### Tone

- **Professional but conversational** (not corporate)
- **Specific, not vague** ("your AI launch" not "your product")
- **Genuine, not clickbaity** (deliver on the promise)

### Personalization

- **Use their name** (if it fits naturally)
- **Reference specific detail** (recent news, hiring, product launch)
- **Avoid merge tags that look like merge tags** ("Hi {{First_Name}}" is obvious)

---

## A/B Testing Framework

Test these variables:

### Variable 1: Specificity

- **A:** "Quick question"
- **B:** "Quick question about your AI launch"

**Winner:** B (specific beats vague)

### Variable 2: Length

- **B:** "VP of Product role"

**Winner:** A (context beats brevity)

### Variable 3: Tone

- **A:** "Congrats on the Series A!"
- **B:** "Congratulations on your Series A funding round"

**Winner:** A (casual beats formal)

## Tips

1. **Test everything** — What works for one audience may not work for another
2. **Be specific** — "Your AI launch" beats "your product" every time
3. **Keep it short** — 30-50 characters is ideal
4. **Avoid spam triggers** — No ALL CAPS, !!!, or "FREE"
5. **Match the email body** — Subject line should match the content
6. **Use their language** — If they say "design system", use "design system" (not "component library")
