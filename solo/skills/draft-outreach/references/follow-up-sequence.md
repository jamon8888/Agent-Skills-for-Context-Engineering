# Follow-Up Sequence Templates

A complete 3-touch outreach sequence with exact timing, tone calibration, and context-specific variants.

---

## The Core Principle

Most deals happen on touch 3–5, but most solopreneurs stop after 1–2. The sequence below is calibrated to feel helpful, not pestering. Each touch adds value rather than just asking for a reply.

**Response rate benchmarks:**
- Touch 1 (cold email): 15–25% with good personalization
- Touch 2 (follow-up): 5–10% additional
- Touch 3 (breakup): 15–20% additional (counterintuitively high)
- Total sequence: 35–55% response rate from qualified prospects

## Standard 3-Touch Sequence

### Touch 1: The Initial Outreach

Send on: Day 1

```
Subject: [Specific hook based on research]

Hi [First Name],

[ATTENTION: One specific observation — news, hiring, product launch, post they wrote]

[INTEREST: Connect it to a problem you help solve. Keep it about them, not you.]
Most [company type] at your stage struggle with [specific problem]. 

[DESIRE: One concrete proof point]
I helped [similar company] [specific outcome with a number].

[ACTION: One low-friction ask]
Worth a 15-minute call to see if I could do the same for you?

[Your name]

P.S. [Optional: add a second reason to reply — a relevant resource, case study, or observation]
```

**Length:** 120–180 words
**Tone:** Professional, direct, specific

---

### Touch 2: The Value-Add Follow-Up

Send on: Day 4–5 (after 3–4 business days, not the next morning)

**Purpose:** Don't just follow up to follow up. Add something.

```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note from [day]. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short.

While prepping for a potential conversation, I put together [a quick audit / a few observations / a short analysis] of [their company / their website / their approach to X].

[2–3 specific observations — the kind that show you actually looked]

Here's the full [audit/analysis] if you want it: [offer to share, don't attach unsolicited]

Is this useful? Happy to walk you through it in 15 minutes.

[Your name]
```

**Length:** 80–120 words
**Tone:** Helpful, not pushy
**The key:** Give something of genuine value before asking for a meeting again

**Variants based on prospect type:**

*For content-creators / thought leaders:*
> "I read your post on [topic]. One thing I'd add from my work with [similar companies]: [specific insight]. Happy to share more if useful."

*For companies with public hiring signals:*
> "I noticed you're hiring a [role]. That usually means [relevant inference]. I've helped 3 companies in [industry] navigate this transition — happy to share what worked."

*For companies with recent news:*
> "Congrats on [recent news]. I've seen companies at this stage face [specific challenge] — happy to share how [similar company] handled it."

---

### Touch 3: The Breakup Email

Send on: Day 10–14 (5–7 business days after Touch 2)

**Purpose:** Creates urgency through scarcity. Paradoxically, breakup emails generate some of the highest response rates because people dislike the feeling of having ignored someone.

```
Subject: Closing the loop — [Company]

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a couple of times about [brief topic] and haven't heard back — which usually means either timing is off, it's not a priority, or my emails landed in the wrong place.

Any of those true?

Before I stop following up, I'm genuinely curious: what's your biggest challenge around [problem area] right now?

No pitch — I'm asking because I work in this space and occasionally come across useful resources, introductions, or ideas.

If it's just not the right time, totally understand. I'll follow up again in [3/6] months.

[Your name]
```

**Length:** 70–100 words
**Tone:** Gracious, curious, genuinely helpful
**Key psychology:** Opens an easy exit (timing isn't right), but also invites a "helpful" conversation that costs them nothing. Very low-friction response to give.

---

## Sequence Variants by Context

### Warm Intro Sequence (Via Mutual Connection)

Much shorter. The intro does the trust-building work.

**Touch 1:**
```
Subject: [Mutual name] suggested I reach out

Hi [First Name],

[Mutual name] mentioned we should connect — apparently we're both working on [shared problem/interest/context].

[One sentence on what you do and who you help]

Would a quick call make sense? Happy to work around your schedule.

[Your name]
```

**Touch 2 (if no reply after 5 days):**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on my note from [day]. I know [mutual name] may have already flagged a lot of intros lately.

If it's useful, happy to connect. If timing's off, no pressure.

[Your name]
```

**Note:** With warm intros, 2 touches max. Pushing harder risks damaging the relationship with the connector.

---

### Post-Event / Conference Sequence

**Touch 1 (within 48 hours of event):**
```
Subject: Great meeting you at [Event]

Hi [First Name],

Great chatting at [Event] yesterday — particularly enjoyed your point about [specific thing they said].

I'd love to continue the conversation about [topic]. Are you open to a call in the next week or two?

[Your name]
```

**Touch 2 (7 days later, if no reply):**
```
Subject: Re: Great meeting you at [Event]

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note from [day]. If the timing's off, no problem — happy to reconnect at [next event / in a few months].

In the meantime, I thought you'd find this useful: [relevant article, tool, or insight related to your conversation]

[Your name]
```

---

### Proposal Follow-Up Sequence

When you've sent a proposal and heard nothing.

**Touch 1 (3 days after proposal):**
```
Subject: Quick check-in on [Project Name] proposal

Hi [First Name],

Checking in on the proposal I sent [day]. Did it land in a good place? Happy to clarify anything or adjust if scope needs to change.

[Your name]
```

**Touch 2 (7 days after Touch 1):**
```
Subject: Re: [Project Name] proposal

Hi [First Name],

Following up one more time. I have [a small question about X / a thought that might affect the approach] I wanted to share before we move forward.

Also, I have [another project / my calendar] filling up for [month] — wanted to flag this in case timing matters for your start date.

Worth 15 minutes this week?

[Your name]
```

**Touch 3 (10 days after Touch 2):**
```
Subject: Closing the loop on [Project Name]

Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming the timing isn't right or the project has shifted. No problem at all.

I'll mark this as on hold and check back in [month]. If anything changes sooner, you know where to find me.

[Your name]
```

## Timing & Sending Best Practices

**Best send times (by study data):**
- Email: Tuesday–Thursday, 7–9 AM or 1–3 PM (recipient's timezone)
- LinkedIn: Tuesday–Thursday, 8–10 AM
- Avoid: Monday morning (inbox chaos), Friday afternoon (mentally checked out)

**Subject line consistency:**
- Touch 2 and 3 should always be "Re: [original subject]" — this threads the conversation and has higher open rates (feels like a continuation, not a new pitch)

**Spacing:**
- Never follow up the next day (desperate)
- Never wait more than 10 business days (they've forgotten you)
- Sweet spot: 4–7 business days between touches

**When to abandon the sequence:**
- After Touch 3 with no response: move to "revisit in 3–6 months" list
- After any negative response: remove immediately
- If they ask to be removed from your list: honor immediately and graciously
