## Template 1: The Research-Led Cold Email (Default)

Best for: Most B2B cold outreach where you've done research.

```
Subject: [Specific, research-based hook — see subject line guide in references/subject-lines.md]

Hi [First Name],

[ATTENTION: One sentence that proves you researched them. Reference something specific — a product launch, a post they wrote, a hiring signal, a company announcement. Not "I found you on LinkedIn."]

[INTEREST: One sentence connecting their specific situation to a problem you solve. Don't say "many companies struggle with X" — say "companies [at their stage / doing X / in Y industry] usually hit [specific challenge] at this point."]

[DESIRE: One proof point. One. The most relevant case study or outcome. Include a specific number if you have one.]
I helped [similar company] [specific outcome — e.g., "cut design time by 40% during their Series A sprint"].

[ACTION: One ask. Low-friction. Not "can we schedule a 30-minute intro call." Try "worth a quick chat?" or "would it be useful if I shared how we approached this?"]

[Your name]

P.S. [Optional, but effective. Add a second observation, relevant resource, or mutual connection.]
```

**Target length:** 120–160 words.
**Check before sending:**
- [ ] Does the opening line prove I actually researched them?
- [ ] Is there a real, named proof point (not "I've worked with companies like yours")?
- [ ] Is there one and only one ask?
- [ ] Is it under 160 words?
- [ ] Could a competitor send this exact email? (If yes, it's not specific enough)

## Template 2: The Pattern Interrupt

Best for: Prospects who get a lot of cold email (VPs, founders at well-known companies).

```
Subject: [Lowercase, conversational — e.g., "quick thought on your checkout flow"]

Hi [First Name],

I'll skip the usual intro.

[One unexpected observation about their business — something they'd be surprised you noticed.]

[Your very short value prop, framed as "I help X do Y" — 1 sentence.]

Worth 15 minutes?

[Your name]
```

**Target length:** 50–70 words.
**Why it works:** Brevity itself signals confidence. Most cold emails over-explain. This one trusts the prospect to ask for more if interested.

---

## Template 3: The Mutual Connection Intro

Best for: When someone has made a warm introduction.

```
Subject: [Mutual name] suggested I reach out

Hi [First Name],

[Mutual name] mentioned we should connect — [one sentence on the common ground or why they made the connection].

[One sentence on what you do and the most relevant thing you'd bring to the conversation.]

Would a 20-minute call make sense? Happy to work around your schedule.

[Your name]
```

**Target length:** 60–80 words.
**Note:** With a warm intro, you don't need to sell yourself — the trust transfer has happened. Keep it short and personal.

---

## Template 4: The Content Touchpoint

Best for: Prospects who are active on LinkedIn or Twitter/X and have published something relevant.

```
Subject: Your [post / article / talk] on [topic]

Hi [First Name],

Your recent [post/article/talk] on [topic] resonated — particularly [specific point they made].

[One sentence adding genuine value: an additional perspective, a related data point, a connection they might not have made. This is not a compliment sandwich — it's a real contribution.]

I work with [type of company] on [related problem]. Given what you wrote, I wonder if [specific question or observation relevant to their business].

Worth a conversation?

[Your name]
```

**Target length:** 90–120 words.
**The critical piece:** The middle paragraph must be genuinely valuable — not just validation. If you can't add something real, use Template 1 instead.

---

## Template 5: The Hiring Signal Email

Best for: Companies that have recently posted a job that signals a problem you solve.

```
Subject: [Company] is hiring a [role] — a thought

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] is hiring a [role]. That usually signals [relevant inference — e.g., "you're scaling your content output" or "you're rebuilding your design system"].

I help [similar companies in that situation]. Most recently with [relevant company + outcome].

Happy to share what worked, no strings. Worth a quick chat?

[Your name]
```

**Target length:** 70–90 words.
**Why hiring signals work:** They reveal strategic priorities that aren't public yet. Referencing them shows you're paying attention.

## Subject Line Quick Reference

Full guide in `references/subject-lines.md`. Quick picks:

| Context | Subject Line Format | Example |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Recent company news | Reference the news directly | "Congrats on the Series A" |
| Hiring signal | "Saw you're hiring a [role]" | "Saw you're hiring a head of design" |
| Content/post | "Your post on [topic]" | "Your post on pricing psychology" |
| Warm intro | "[Name] suggested I reach out" | "Sarah mentioned we should talk" |
| Specific problem | Name the problem | "Design consistency during hypergrowth" |
| Value offer | Specific deliverable for them | "Free audit of your onboarding flow" |

**Avoid:**
- "Quick question" (vague)
- "Following up" (zero reason to open)
- "I can help you [grow/scale/save money]" (generic)
- "Collaboration opportunity" (spam filter)

## The Pre-Send Checklist

Before hitting send on any outreach:

**Personalization:**
- [ ] Does the opening line prove I researched this specific person / company?
- [ ] Is the pain point specific to their situation, not just their industry?
- [ ] Am I referencing a real, named company in the proof point?

**Clarity:**
- [ ] Is there one and only one CTA?
- [ ] Is the ask low-friction (15 min, not 45 min)?
- [ ] Is it under 175 words?

**Voice:**
- [ ] Does this sound like me, not like a sales email?
- [ ] Have I removed any corporate-speak? ("synergies", "leverage", "circle back")
- [ ] Have I removed any opener that starts with "I" ("I wanted to reach out...")?

**Technical:**
- [ ] Is the email address verified (not guessed)?
- [ ] Has the subject line been checked: under 60 characters, specific, no ALL CAPS?
- [ ] Is the follow-up reminder set for 4–5 business days?

## What Good Personalization Looks Like

**Bad (generic):**
> "I help SaaS companies improve their design. I've worked with many startups and would love to help you."

**Better (industry-specific):**
> "I help Series A SaaS companies build their first design system. The usual challenge is consistency across a fast-growing product — different designers, different components."

**Good (company-specific):**
> "I saw Acme just launched three new product lines in Q4. That level of expansion usually surfaces design consistency issues — teams shipping independently, components diverging."

**The test:** Could this opening line be sent to more than 5 companies? If yes, it's not personalized enough.
