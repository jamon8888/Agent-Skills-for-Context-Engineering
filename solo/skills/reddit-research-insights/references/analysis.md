# Reddit Analysis Framework

Use this framework to categorize the qualitative data you find in Reddit threads. The goal is to turn unstructured conversations into structured insights.

For each relevant post or comment, try to extract and categorize the following:

---

### 1. Pain Points

*Direct quotes or paraphrased descriptions of problems, frustrations, and challenges.*

-   **What to look for:** Phrases like "I hate it when...", "The worst part is...", "Does anyone else struggle with...".
-   **Example:** "The app is great, but I waste so much time manually exporting the data every week."

### 2. Desired Solutions & Features

*Specific features or outcomes that users say they want.*

-   **What to look for:** Phrases like "I wish it had...", "Why can't it just...", "It would be perfect if...".
-   **Example:** "I just want a simple 'Export to CSV' button in the dashboard."

### 3. Competitor Mentions

*Mentions of your competitors, both positive and negative.*

-   **What to look for:** Direct comparisons ("Product A vs. Product B"), complaints about competitors, praise for competitors.
-   **Example:** "I'm currently using CompetitorX, but their pricing is too high for a small team."

### 4. Jargon & Common Language

*The specific words and phrases the audience uses to describe their world.*

-   **What to look for:** Acronyms, slang, or non-obvious terms that are used frequently within the community.
-   **Example:** In a finance subreddit, noticing that everyone refers to "asset allocation" as "AA".

### 5. Workarounds & Hacks

*Clever or ad-hoc solutions users have created to solve a problem that existing tools don't address well.*

-   **What to look for:** "Here's my script for...", "The trick is to...", "I made a little tool that...".
-   **Example:** "I wrote a Python script that uses their unofficial API to automatically download my reports." This is a powerful signal for a needed feature.
