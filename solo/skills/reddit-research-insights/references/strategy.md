# Reddit Research Strategy

This guide helps identify the best places to look for insights on Reddit.

## 1. Identifying Target Subreddits

Your goal is to find where your Ideal Client Profile (ICP) spends their time.

-   **Professional Subreddits:** Look for subreddits related to your ICP's job title or industry.
    -   *Examples:* `r/sales`, `r/sysadmin`, `r/marketing`
-   **Hobbyist/Interest Subreddits:** Look for subreddits related to the *problem space* you solve, even if it's not explicitly professional.
    -   *Examples:* `r/personalfinance`, `r/homeautomation`, `r/productivity`
-   **Tool-Specific Subreddits:** Look for subreddits dedicated to the tools your ICP already uses, especially your competitors. This is a goldmine for finding complaints and desired features.
    -   *Examples:* `r/Salesforce`, `r/photoshop`, `r/Notion`

## 2. Formulating Search Keywords

Once you have your target subreddits, use a combination of keywords to find relevant discussions.

-   **Problem-Oriented Keywords:**
    -   `"how do you handle X"`
    -   `"annoyed with X"`
    -   `"alternative to X"`
    -   `"wish I could X"`
    -   `"frustrated with"`
-   **Solution-Oriented Keywords:**
    -   `"best tool for X"`
    -   `"recommendation for"`
    -   `"looking for a tool that"`
-   **Competitor Keywords:**
    -   `"[Competitor Name] vs"`
    -   `"hate [Competitor Name]"`
    -   `"moving from [Competitor Name]"`
