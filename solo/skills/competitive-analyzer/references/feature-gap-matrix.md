## Main Grid

| Feature / Dimension | [Competitor A] | [Competitor B] | [Competitor C] | Status Quo | [Your Product] |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| **[Dimension 1]** | 🟢 Strong | 🟡 Average | 🔴 Weak | 🔴 | ? |
| **[Dimension 2]** | 🟡 | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🔴 | ? |
| **[Dimension 3]** | 🔴 | 🔴 | 🔴 | 🔴 | ← GAP |
| **[Dimension 4]** | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🟡 | 🟢 | (table stakes) |
| **Entry-level price** | $[X]/mo | $[X]/mo | Free | Free | ? |

## Scoring Legend

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🟢 Strong | Clearly above market average |
| 🟡 Average | Within the norm — neither differentiating nor blocking |
| 🔴 Weak | Below expectations, frequently cited as a frustration |
| ← GAP | Absent from all players — opportunity |
| (table stakes) | Required to enter the market, not differentiating |

**Frustrations detected:** [quotes]
**Implication for your product:** [compete / ignore / leapfrog]

### [Dimension 3] ← The Gap
**Current situation:** Nobody does it well
**Why it matters to the ICP:** [reason]
**Risk of filling it:** [technical / commercial difficulties]
**Opportunity level:** High / Medium / Low

                    EASE OF ADOPTION
                    Low ←————————→ High
                    
    ↑               [C]              [B]
    |
FUNCTIONAL     [A]              [GAP]    ← Possible positioning
DEPTH          
    |
    ↓               [Status quo]
```

Place each alternative on the two dimensions most critical to the ICP.
The "GAP" reveals unoccupied space.

## Positioning Decision

Based on this analysis:

**Do NOT compete on:**
- [Dimension X] — [Competitor A] is too entrenched and it's their core advantage
- [Dimension Y] — table stakes, no differentiation possible

**Compete on:**
- [Dimension Z] — clear gap, all players are weak, ICP needs it

**Deliberately ignore:**
- [Dimension W] — your ICP doesn't use it, despite what competitors do with it
```

## Guide to Selecting Dimensions

The 5 dimensions to analyze depend on the product type:

### Productivity tools / B2B SaaS

| Dimension | Why it matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| Time-to-value | How long before seeing a concrete result |
| Functional depth | Does it cover the use case end-to-end |
| Ease of adoption | Can it be used without training |
| Integrations | Does it fit into the existing stack |
| Price / ROI perceived | Is the value/cost ratio obvious |

### No-code / platforms

| Dimension | Why it matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| Flexibility | Can you do what you want without coding |
| Templates / examples | Can you start without building from scratch |
| Free tier limits | Where is the paid friction |
| Scalability | Does it hold at real usage |
| Community | Are there resources / peer support |

### Creator / solopreneur tools

| Dimension | Why it matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| Learning curve | Can it be mastered quickly |
| Output quality | Is the result professional without effort |
| Built-in monetization | Can you sell from within the tool |
| Ownership / data portability | Do you own your data |
| Price to start | Can you begin without investment |

## Interpreting the 4 Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Mature market with a clear leader**
→ One competitor dominates on 3+ dimensions. Strategy: vertical niche (serve a segment the leader ignores) or radical angle (rethink a dimension nobody has questioned).

**Pattern 2: Fragmented market with no leader**
→ Several players are average everywhere. Strategy: become clearly the best at 2 key dimensions for the ICP, ignore the others.

**Pattern 3: Status quo dominant**
→ People hack things together and don't adopt any tool. Reason: either existing tools are too complex, or the pain isn't bad enough. Strategy: radical simplification OR educating on the value.

**Pattern 4: Obvious unaddressed gap**
→ All alternatives are weak on an important dimension for the ICP. Strategy: build around this gap. Warning: verify nobody has already tried and failed (and understand why).
