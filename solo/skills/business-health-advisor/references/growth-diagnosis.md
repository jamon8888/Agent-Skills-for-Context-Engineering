# Growth Diagnosis Guide

Eight common health patterns for solopreneurs — what they mean and what to do about them.

---

## Pattern 1: "Busy But Broke"

**Symptoms:**
- High utilization (85–100%)
- Revenue flat or declining
- Low effective hourly rate (well below target)
- Many active projects, often small ones

**Diagnosis:** You're working at capacity on low-value work. The pipeline fills with small clients because they're easier to close, but they consume the same hours as premium clients.

**Prescription:**
1. Calculate effective hourly rate by service/client type
2. Identify the 20% of clients generating 80% of revenue per hour
3. Set a minimum project size. Decline anything below it.
4. When a small client project ends, don't replace it — use the capacity for prospecting larger clients
5. Raise rates by 20–30% and accept that some current clients won't follow

**Timeline:** 90–120 days to feel the effect on revenue

## Pattern 2: "Growing But Burning Out"

**Symptoms:**
- Revenue growing MoM
- Utilization >100%
- Increasing overdue items
- No wins logged in weekly reviews

**Diagnosis:** Revenue growth is coming at the cost of sustainability. You're growing through overcommitment, not efficiency. This pattern leads to quality problems and then client churn.

**Prescription:**
1. Immediately audit active projects — which can be extended or phased?
2. Communicate proactively with at-risk projects before they're late
3. Set a hard capacity limit: no new projects until utilization is back under 85%
4. Consider: can any work be subcontracted?
5. Add a "capacity buffer" to every future estimate: nothing starts above 80% utilization

**Timeline:** 30–60 days to stabilize

## Pattern 3: "One Client Casino"

**Symptoms:**
- Revenue stable or growing
- One client >50% of total revenue
- Little pipeline activity
- High client satisfaction

**Diagnosis:** The business appears healthy but is structurally fragile. High satisfaction from a dominant client creates false security — you stop prospecting because you don't need to. When that client leaves (and they always eventually do), you have 60 days before a cash crisis.

**Prescription:**
1. Don't reduce service to the dominant client — maintain the relationship
2. Reactivate business development immediately (not when the relationship wobbles)
3. Goal: reduce dominant client to <40% of revenue within 6 months
4. Target: land 2 new clients generating >20% of revenue each
5. Never let pipeline go to 0 regardless of how full you are

**Timeline:** 6–12 months to properly diversify

## Pattern 4: "Revenue Plateau"

**Symptoms:**
- Revenue stable for 3–6 months
- Utilization healthy (70–85%)
- Client satisfaction good
- But no growth

**Diagnosis:** You've reached capacity at current rates. The only ways to grow from here: raise rates, productize a service, create a scalable offering, or hire/subcontract.

**Three growth paths:**

**Path A: Rate Increase**
- Best for: established relationships, in-demand skills
- Action: 15–25% rate increase at next contract renewal
- Risk: some clients won't follow
- Revenue impact: immediate

**Path B: Productize a Service**
- Best for: work you do repeatedly with similar outputs
- Action: Package a common engagement into a fixed-price, fixed-scope product
- Risk: lower perceived customization
- Revenue impact: 3–6 months to build, then scalable

**Path C: Subcontract / Partner**
- Best for: when demand exceeds your capacity
- Action: Build a network of trusted freelancers you can bring in on larger projects
- Risk: quality control, margin compression
- Revenue impact: enables larger project wins

## Pattern 5: "Feast or Famine"

**Symptoms:**
- Revenue highly variable month to month
- Some months at 120% utilization, others at 40%
- Stress around cash flow forecasting
- Project-based (not retainer) revenue model

**Diagnosis:** Classic project-based solopreneur cycle. Short projects complete, revenue drops, then closes new work, revenue spikes. The solution is retainers.

**Prescription:**
1. Identify 2–3 current clients doing repeated projects — propose a retainer
2. Retainer pitch: "Instead of one-off projects, what if you had [X hours/month] of my time on retainer? You'd get priority access and I'd get predictability."
3. Target: at least 30% of revenue in retainers within 6 months
4. Even 2 retainer clients at €1,500/month provides €3K/month baseline — enough to smooth the cycle

**Use the `retainer-manager` skill** to structure and track retainer relationships.

## Pattern 6: "Invisible Growth"

**Symptoms:**
- Working hard, everything feels chaotic
- No visibility into actual trends
- Can't answer "is my business growing?"
- Sporadic tracking of key metrics

**Diagnosis:** Not a business problem — a systems problem. The business may be healthy, but without data you can't see it, manage it, or make good decisions.

**Prescription:**
1. Run the full business health advisor scan this month — establish a baseline
2. Commit to the weekly-review cadence: every Friday, 15 minutes
3. Complete `expense-tracker` setup for expense visibility
4. Configure `capacity-planner` with your actual billable hours target
5. After 90 days of consistent tracking, you'll see the real trends

**Timeline:** 90 days to have meaningful trend data

## Pattern 7: "High Revenue, Low Profit"

**Symptoms:**
- Revenue growing
- But profit margin <40%
- High expenses relative to revenue
- Often: subcontractors eating margin

**Diagnosis:** Either expense creep (too many SaaS tools, unnecessary services) or the subcontractor model is eating margin without adding enough revenue lift.

**Prescription:**
1. Run expense audit: cancel anything not used weekly
2. Audit subcontractor margins: revenue from subcontracted work minus their fees
3. If subcontractors are <40% gross margin: reprice or stop subcontracting
4. Target: 50%+ profit margin (solopreneurs should have low overhead)
5. Common expense cut: SaaS subscriptions. Run an audit — the average solopreneur has €300–600/month in software, half unused.

## Pattern 8: "Strong Today, Weak Tomorrow"

**Symptoms:**
- Current MRR strong
- Pipeline thin (< 1.5× monthly target)
- Little to no new lead activity
- All delivery capacity consumed by current projects

**Diagnosis:** You're delivering well but not selling. Revenue looks healthy now but will drop in 60–90 days when current projects complete and the pipeline is empty.

**This is the most common solopreneur pattern.** Delivery and business development naturally compete for time. When projects are active, BD stops. When projects end, you scramble.

**Prescription:**
1. Reserve 4 hours per week for business development — non-negotiable
2. Even at full capacity, keep prospecting at a minimum cadence (1–2 touchpoints/week)
3. Use `draft-outreach` to make outreach faster (30 minutes, not 3 hours)
4. Keep `sales-pipeline` fresh: even low-intent contacts should be logged
5. Target: weighted pipeline always ≥ 3× monthly revenue target

**The right mental model:** Business development is like watering plants. You don't water them when they're dying — you water them consistently.
