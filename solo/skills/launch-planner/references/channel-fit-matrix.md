## The Golden Rules of Channel Selection

### Rule 1: Be where the ICP already is
Don't try to bring the ICP to a new channel. Go where they already spend time and already look for solutions.

### Rule 2: Two channels maximum at launch
Spreading across 5 channels = being mediocre on 5 channels. Dominating 2 channels = having a real presence.

### Rule 3: Distinguish seeding channels from scaling channels

**Seeding channels (0 → 100):** High effort, fast results, not scalable
- Cold outreach
- Community recruitment
- Network activation

**Scaling channels (100 → ∞):** High initial effort, then automatic
- SEO
- Referral
- YouTube
- Recurring organic content

Start with seeding channels. Activate scaling channels once product-market fit is validated.

### Rule 4: Measure before spending

Before paying for a channel, test the organic / free version. If organic cold outreach doesn't convert, LinkedIn Ads won't convert either — the problem is in the message, not the budget.

## Product Hunt: How It Actually Works

Product Hunt deserves a separate section — widely used in the maker community, often misunderstood.

**When it works:**
- Product for developers, designers, makers, or tech early adopters
- Visually demonstrable product (GIF/video required)
- Network of supporters ready to upvote on launch day

**When it doesn't work:**
- B2B with non-tech ICP
- Product requiring a long demo to understand
- Launch without preparation (supporter list, timing)

**The mechanics:**
- Votes in the first hours determine everything
- Goal: mobilize 20-50 people ready to vote at 12:01 AM PST (reset time)
- Don't buy fake upvotes — Product Hunt is getting better at detecting them

**What Product Hunt realistically gives:**
- Credibility ("As seen on Product Hunt")
- 200-2,000 visitors on launch day depending on ranking
- No lasting growth unless your ICP is exactly PH's audience

**Product Hunt doesn't replace a strategy.** It's a moment, not a channel.
