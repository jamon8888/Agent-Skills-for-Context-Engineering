# Discovery Questions Rubric

A comprehensive question bank for sales discovery calls, organized by category and phase. Select 8-12 questions per call — don't interrogate, have a conversation.

---

## Phase 1: Situation (Warm-Up)

**Goal:** Understand their current state. Build rapport. Low-threat questions.

1. "Can you walk me through how you currently handle [problem area]?"
2. "What tools or systems do you use for this today?"
3. "How big is the team working on this?"
4. "How long have you been doing it this way?"
5. "What prompted you to take this call / look into this now?"
6. "What does a typical week look like for you regarding [topic]?"

**Listen for:** Process gaps, tool frustration, team size (budget indicator), trigger events.

---

## Phase 2: Problem (Core Discovery)

**Goal:** Dig into pain. This is where the value lives. Spend the most time here.

7. "What are the biggest challenges with that process?"
8. "What happens when [specific failure scenario]?"
9. "How much time/money does this cost you per month?"
10. "What have you tried before to solve this?"
11. "Why didn't that work?"
12. "If you had to rank your top 3 priorities right now, where does this fall?"
13. "What workarounds has your team built to deal with this?"
14. "What's the most frustrating part of the current process?"
15. "How do your customers/end-users feel about this?"

**Listen for:** Emotional language ("frustrating", "nightmare"), quantified pain (hours, euros), failed past attempts (indicates budget willingness).

## Phase 3: Impact (Business Case)

**Goal:** Connect pain to business outcomes. This justifies the investment.

16. "What's the business impact if this isn't solved this quarter?"
17. "How does this affect your team / customers / revenue?"
18. "If you could solve this perfectly, what would change?"
19. "What's this costing you in terms of [lost deals / churn / productivity]?"
20. "How is this affecting your ability to [grow / scale / compete]?"

**Listen for:** Revenue impact, customer churn, competitive disadvantage, team burnout. These become ROI arguments in your proposal.

## Phase 4: Decision Process

**Goal:** Understand how they buy. Only ask once rapport is established.

21. "Who else is involved in decisions like this?"
22. "What does your evaluation process typically look like?"
23. "Is there a budget allocated, or would we need to build a business case?"
24. "What's your ideal timeline for getting this resolved?"
25. "What would make you say 'no' to working together?"
26. "Have you seen a solution that impressed you? What did you like about it?"
27. "What criteria will you use to evaluate options?"

**Listen for:** Multiple stakeholders (multi-thread opportunity), existing budget (faster close), evaluation criteria (tailor your proposal).

---

## Phase 5: Close & Next Steps

**Goal:** Always end with a clear, committed next step.

28. "Based on what we've discussed, I think I can help with [X]. Shall I put together a proposal?"
29. "What's the best next step from your side?"
30. "When should we reconnect to review a proposal?"
31. "Is there anyone else who should be in our next conversation?"
32. "What information would be most helpful for me to send you?"

## Situational Add-Ons

### If They Mention a Competitor
- "What do you like most about [competitor]?"
- "What's the one thing you wish they did better?"
- "How long have you been with them?"

### If They Seem Hesitant
- "What concerns do you have about making a change?"
- "What would need to be true for you to feel confident about this?"
- "Is there something I haven't addressed that's on your mind?"

### If They're In a Rush
- "I want to respect your time — what's the single most important thing you'd like to get from this call?"
- "If I could solve one problem for you today, what would it be?"

## Question Selection Guide

| Call Type | Focus On | Skip |
|-----------|----------|------|
| First call, cold lead | Situation + Problem | Decision (too early) |
| Inbound lead (they came to you) | Problem + Impact | Situation (they already know they have a problem) |
| Second call / follow-up | Impact + Decision | Situation (already covered) |
| Enterprise / large deal | All phases, go deep | Nothing — thorough discovery = better proposals |
| Quick qualification | Situation + Budget/Timeline | Deep problem exploration (save for next call) |
