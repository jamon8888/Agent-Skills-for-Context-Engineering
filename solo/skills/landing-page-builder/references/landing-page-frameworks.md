# Landing Page Frameworks: PAS, AIDA, Before/After/Bridge

Three narrative structures for organizing landing page copy based on visitor awareness level.

---

## Choosing the Right Framework

| Framework | Visitor | Awareness level | Ideal for |
|-----------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **PAS** | Aware of the problem, not the solution | Intermediate | Markets where the pain is very real |
| **AIDA** | Barely aware of the problem | Low | New markets, innovative products |
| **Before/After/Bridge** | Aware of problem AND that solutions exist | High | Competitive markets, repositioning |

---

## Framework 1: PAS (Problem → Agitation → Solution)

**Logic:** Name the problem, amplify the pain, present the solution as relief.

**When to use:** The ICP knows they have a problem but isn't actively looking for a solution yet. The page must create urgency to act.

---

### PAS Structure for a Landing Page

**Hero (P — Problem)**
```
Headline: Name the central problem or frustration
Subheadline: Specify who this happens to and in what context

Example:
"You spend more time invoicing than delivering."
"For freelancers whose clients pay at 60 days instead of 30."
```

**Section 2 (A — Agitation)**
```
Develop the consequences of the unsolved problem:
- Financial consequence: "Every week of delay = $X of missing cash flow"
- Emotional consequence: "The stress of not knowing if you'll get paid this month"
- Opportunity cost: "While you're managing follow-ups, your competitors are prospecting"

Agitation techniques:
- Concrete numbers ("on average 18% of invoices are paid late")
- "If nothing changes" scenario ("in 6 months, you'll have lost $X")
- Contrast ("you did the work — why should you still fight to get paid?")
```

**Sections 3–5 (S — Solution)**
```
Introduce the product as direct relief:
- Name the solution in direct relation to the agitated pain
- "What if [the problem disappeared]?"
- How it works (3 steps)
- Features → Benefits
- Social proof
- CTA
```

### Full PAS Example

**Hero:**
> # You're chasing your payments. Your clients should be chasing you.
> For B2B consultants and freelancers billing complex projects — and waiting.

**Agitation:**
> In the US, 23% of B2B invoices are paid late. For freelancers, that figure exceeds 40%.
>
> This isn't just a cash flow problem. It's the time spent on follow-ups (2 hours/week on average), the mental energy it takes, and the client relationship that deteriorates with every clumsy reminder.
>
> Meanwhile, some of your competitors have automated these follow-ups. And they've reclaimed that time for prospecting.

**Solution:**
> Noté sends the follow-ups for you — your style, your tone, at the right time.
> Setup in 10 minutes. No follow-up sent without your approval.

---

## Framework 2: AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

**Logic:** Capture attention, create interest, build desire, trigger action.

**When to use:** The ICP is not necessarily aware of the problem or the solution. The page must educate before selling.

---

### AIDA Structure for a Landing Page

**Hero (A — Attention)**
```
Attention-grabbing headline: surprising number, rhetorical question, counter-intuitive claim
Goal: stop the scroll, not sell

Example:
"127 hours. That's how much time the average freelancer wastes on admin tasks every year."
```

**Section 2 (I — Interest)**
```
Develop why this matters specifically to THEM:
- Market context
- Why now
- What this means concretely in their life

No product yet. We're building relevance.
```

**Section 3 (D — Desire)**
```
Present the solution + prove it works:
- Vision of the world with the product
- Testimonials / proof
- Features as proof of the promise
- Before/after comparison
```

**Section 4 (A — Action)**
```
Single, clear CTA with risk reduction:
- Primary button
- Proof point below the button
- Optional: guarantee or trial
```

---

### Full AIDA Example

**Attention:**
> # 40% of freelancers say they've abandoned a project because of admin complexity.
> It's not a talent problem. It's a systems problem.

**Interest:**
> When you work alone, every hour spent invoicing, following up, or tracking prospects is an hour less on your actual work. And unlike a company, you don't have an admin assistant.
>
> Most tools on the market are built for teams. Too complex, too expensive, too generic for a solopreneur.

**Desire:**
> Solo is the first tool built exclusively for independent B2B workers.
> [features + benefits + testimonials]

**Action:**
> Start today — 14 days free, no credit card.
> 1,200 freelancers are already using it.

## Framework 3: Before/After/Bridge

**Logic:** Sharply contrast the current situation with the desired situation, then present the product as the bridge.

**When to use:** The ICP knows exactly what they want but is choosing between multiple solutions. The page must make the "after" state so desirable that the choice is obvious.

---

### Before/After/Bridge Structure

**Before (current situation)**
```
Precise description of life with the problem.
Concrete details, not generic.

Technique: "Here's your current week..."
Monday: [painful task]
Tuesday: [painful task]
...

Or: list of frustrations in short, punchy bullets
```

**After (desired situation)**
```
Precise description of life with the solution.
Same level of detail as the Before.

Technique: "Here's your week with [product]..."
Or: point-by-point contrast with the Before
```

**Bridge (the bridge)**
```
Present the product as the transformation mechanism:
- How it works (3 steps)
- Why it works better than alternatives
- Proof that others have made the crossing (testimonials)
- CTA
```

---

### Full Before/After/Bridge Example

**Before:**
> **Your current Monday:**
> - 8:00 AM: Open email, see 3 overdue reminders from slow-paying clients
> - 9:00 AM: Spend 45 minutes writing follow-ups that aren't "too aggressive"
> - 10:30 AM: Look at the pipeline, realize 2 prospects have gone silent for 3 weeks
> - 11:00 AM: Work on a client project, but mentally elsewhere
>
> **What this costs you:** 2 hours of lost work, tension with clients, mental energy drained before you've even started.

**After:**
> **Your Monday with Solo:**
> - 8:00 AM: Open the dashboard, see the day's brief: 3 priorities, week's revenue, 1 pipeline alert
> - 8:15 AM: Approve the 2 follow-ups prepared automatically overnight
> - 8:20 AM: Start your real work
>
> **What this frees up:** 1h45 recovered every Monday, no follow-up written by hand, pipeline up to date without effort.

**Bridge:**
> Solo automates the admin tasks that eat your morning.
> [How it works → Features → Testimonials → CTA]

## Combining Frameworks

On a long landing page (heavy scroll), you can combine:
- **Hero:** Before/After/Bridge (immediate contrast)
- **Middle section:** PAS (agitation for those still hesitating)
- **Bottom section:** AIDA Action (simplify for the final decision)

The essential thing: the visitor must feel at every point of the page that you understand exactly where they are.
