## Headline Checklist

Before finalizing:

```
[ ] Does it speak to a user outcome (not a feature)?
[ ] Is it understandable without knowing the product?
[ ] Does it pass the 5-second test?
[ ] Does it name the ICP directly or indirectly?
[ ] Is it different from the headlines of the 3 main competitors?
[ ] Is it under 12 words?
[ ] Does it avoid empty superlatives ("best", "revolutionary", "powerful")?
```

## What to Absolutely Avoid

| ❌ Pattern | Why | ✅ Alternative |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| "The best [tool] on the market" | Unproven, seen everywhere | Name the specific differentiator |
| "[Adjective] solution for [generic]" | Too vague | Name the ICP and the outcome |
| "All-in-one platform" | Says nothing | Say what it actually does |
| "Simplify your [workflow]" | Corporate, cold | Talk about the outcome, not the simplification |
| "[Tool] for professionals" | Who isn't a professional? | Name the exact sector or company size |
| "Boost your productivity" | Overused, empty | "Recover 5 hours per week" |

## Recommended A/B Test

Test 2 headline types first:

**Version A: Direct outcome**
"[Verb] [concrete result] in [timeframe]"

**Version B: Named problem**
"Stop [problem]. [Direct solution]."

In most markets where the pain is real, Version B converts better with cold traffic. Version A converts better with warm traffic (audience already aware of the problem).
