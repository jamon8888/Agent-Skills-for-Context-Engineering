# Comprehensive Guide to Customer Journey Mapping

This guide provides a complete methodology for creating and facilitating a customer journey map, combining a structural framework with a workshop facilitation script.

## Part 1: The Framework (The "What")

A journey map visualizes how customers interact with your brand. For each stage, we analyze the following:

-   **Customer Actions**: What are they concretely doing?
-   **Touchpoints**: Where does the interaction happen? (Website, ad, email, word-of-mouth).
-   **Customer Experience**: Their emotions ("Skeptical," "Delighted") and thoughts.
-   **KPIs**: How do you measure success at this stage?
-   **Business Goals**: What do you want them to do?
-   **Involved Teams**: Who is responsible for this stage?

### The 5 Stages of the Journey

1.  **Awareness**: The customer discovers your existence.
2.  **Consideration**: The customer evaluates your offering against others.
3.  **Decision**: The customer takes action (purchase, sign-up).
4.  **Service**: The customer uses your product or service.
5.  **Loyalty**: The customer returns and becomes an advocate.

## Part 2: The Workshop Script (The "How")

This is a script for facilitating an interactive journey mapping workshop.

### Key Components of the Map

-   **Actor**: A specific persona that anchors the map.
-   **Scenario**: The context and goals of the actor (e.g., first-time use, core task).
-   **Phases**: The high-level chronological stages of the journey.
-   **Emotional Curve**: The granular mapping of the actor's actions, thoughts, and feelings (😊, 😐, 😞).
-   **Opportunities**: The high-impact pain points identified for improvement.

### Key Facilitation Questions

1.  **Who is the Actor?** (Which persona are we mapping?)
2.  **What is the Scenario?** (What specific goal are they trying to achieve?)
3.  **What are the Phases?** (Let's break the journey down into 4-6 high-level steps).
4.  **What are the detailed Actions, Thoughts, and Emotions in each phase?**
5.  **Where are the Opportunities?** (Where does the emotional curve dip? Let's focus there.)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

-   **Vague Emotions**: Avoid "the customer is happy." Be specific: "Relieved by the simplicity."
-   **Internal Perspective**: Don't map what you *want* them to do. Map what they *really* do.
-   **Forgetting Physical Touchpoints**: Word-of-mouth is a touchpoint.
