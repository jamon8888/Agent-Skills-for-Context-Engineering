# The Solopreneur Profitability Masterclass: Pricing for Freedom

For a solopreneur, pricing is not just about "covering costs." it is about **buying back your time**. This guide moves you from commodity hourly rates to high-margin, value-based pricing.

## 1. The 4 Levels of Pricing Mastery

### Level 1: Hourly (The "Employee" Trap)

- **Logic**: You sell time.
- **Risk**: You are penalized for being fast.
- **Mastery Tip**: Only use hourly for "Discovery" or "Maintenance" where the scope is a black hole. Set your hourly rate to at least 3x your desired salary.

### Level 2: Project-Based (The "Deliverable" Model)

- **Logic**: You sell a finished product (e.g., a Website).
- **Mastery Tip**: Build in a 20% "Scope Creep Insurance" buffer. Use `prd-development.md` to lock the "Out of Scope" section.

### Level 3: Retainer (The "Peace of Mind" Model)

- **Logic**: You sell availability or ongoing advisory.
- **Mastery Tip**: Shift from "Retainer for Work" to "Retainer for Access." You aren't doing 10 hours of work; you are providing the safety that you are _there_ when needed.

### Level 4: Value-Based (The "Gold Standard")

- **Logic**: You sell a result.
- **The Equation**: `(Financial Benefit to Client x 10%) = Your Price`.
- **Mastery Tip**: If you help a client save $100k, a $10k price tag is a 90,000% ROI for them. They would be foolish to say no.

## 2. The "Triple Tier" Strategy (Anchoring)

Never provide a single price. Always provide three options to give the client "The Power of Choice."

| Tier         | Name            | Focus                    | Psychology                               |
| :----------- | :-------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Option 1** | The Foundation  | Core problem solved.     | "The Budget Option"                      |
| **Option 2** | The Standard    | Full solution + Support. | "The No-Brainer" (80% will pick this)    |
| **Option 3** | The Accelerated | High-speed + High-touch. | "The Anchor" (Makes Option 2 look cheap) |

## 3. The Solopreneur "Tax & Health" Calculation

Before you set your rate, ensure you pass the **Solo Viability Audit**:

- [ ] **The 0.6 Rule**: You will only spend 60% of your time on billable work. Does your rate cover the other 40% (Admin/Marketing)?
- [ ] **The "Real" Overhead**: Do you account for SaaS subs, hardware, taxes (approx 30%), and health insurance?
- [ ] **The Vacation Fund**: Does your annual income target include 4-6 weeks of unbillable rest?

## 4. Implementation in the OS

1.  **Calculate**: Use the `financial-health` skill to audit your current profit margins.
2.  **Repricing**: Draft new proposals using the `Triple Tier` logic.
3.  **Validate**: Save your wins in `revenue-log.md` and adjust your `business-profile.json` as your "Value" increases.
