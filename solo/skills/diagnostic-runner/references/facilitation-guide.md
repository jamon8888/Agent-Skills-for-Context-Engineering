# Facilitation Guide: Running Diagnostics Well

The mechanics of scoring are simple. What makes a diagnostic session excellent is what happens around the questions — the pacing, the handling of ambiguous answers, and what you read from the session beyond the formal score.

---

## Pacing

**One question at a time.** Never display the next question until the current one is answered. The cadence matters — it signals that each question is worth sitting with.

**Don't rush the intro.** The opening 30 seconds sets the tone. A good intro reduces social pressure ("there are no right answers") and increases honest responding.

**Let the score land.** After delivering the score, pause before the recommendation. The reveal should feel deliberate, not mechanical. Write "Let me put your results together." and actually give it a line before showing the number.

---

## Handling Ambiguous or Off-Script Answers

Respondents won't always pick from your options — especially in conversational mode. They'll say things like "it depends" or "somewhere between B and C" or launch into a story.

**Rule:** Never force an answer. Interpret and confirm.

**"It depends" answers:**

> "Makes sense that it depends. For the purposes of this — thinking about your most common situation or the scenario that comes up most often — which of these fits best?"

**"Between two options" answers:**

> "I'd lean toward [the lower of the two] as the scoring choice — [brief reason]. Does that feel right, or do you think [higher option] is closer?"

Always round toward the option the respondent has actually demonstrated, not the one they aspire to. The diagnostic reflects current reality, not ambition.

**Long story answers:**

Listen to the story, then map it to an option:

> "Based on what you've described — [1-sentence summary] — I'm reading that as [Option B]. Fair?"

If they correct you, use their correction without commentary.

## Reading Beyond the Score

The most valuable information in a diagnostic session often isn't the answer they select — it's the hesitation before they answer, the story they tell, or the question they ask.

**Signs to note (not score):**

| Signal | What it may indicate |
|--------|---------------------|
| Long pause before answering | The question is touching something real — worth exploring after the session |
| Corrects a higher score option downward | More self-aware and honest than average — trust their lower self-assessment |
| Repeatedly picks the lowest option | Either genuinely struggling, or highly critical of themselves — worth checking |
| Tells a story unprompted | High engagement — they want to be understood, not just scored |
| Skips or deflects a question | Something uncomfortable in that area — may be the most important dimension |
| Asks "what's the right answer?" | Socially oriented — gently redirect: "There's no right answer — just what's true for you" |

**After the session:** Include a brief "Notes" section in the response file capturing anything beyond the formal answers. This is the qualitative layer that a form can't produce.

## When the Respondent Disagrees with Their Score

Occasionally someone will get their result and push back: "That doesn't sound like me" or "I think I'm doing better than that."

**Don't defend the score.** The score is a starting point for conversation, not a verdict.

> "The score is based on your answers to these specific questions — it's one lens, not the full picture. What feels off about it?"

Let them explain. Often they'll reveal context that either validates the score ("yeah, I said X but actually...") or surfaces a genuine nuance worth noting. Either way, the conversation is more valuable than defending the number.

---

## The Follow-Up Offer

After delivering the score and recommendation, always offer one concrete next step — tied to the CTA in the band recommendation, but offered conversationally:

**For lead diagnostics:**
> "Based on your score, the most useful next step would be [priority_action]. Would it be helpful if I put together a short note on how I'd approach [their specific situation]?"

**For client health:**
> "Given the score on [lowest dimension], it might be worth a quick conversation about [dimension topic] before we continue. Want me to draft a check-in message you could send?"

**For self-assessments:**
> "The [lowest dimension] area is worth sitting with. Do you want to go deeper on that now, or should I flag it for your weekly review?"

The follow-up offer converts the diagnostic from a snapshot into the start of a conversation.

## Session Time Management

| Total questions | Estimated session time |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 8 (4 dim × 2Q) | 5–7 minutes |
| 12 (4 dim × 3Q) | 8–10 minutes |
| 15 (5 dim × 3Q) | 10–13 minutes |
| 20 (5 dim × 4Q) | 15–18 minutes |

If the session is running long (respondent is giving detailed answers), it's a positive signal — don't rush. The depth of engagement often predicts the quality of the lead or the depth of the client relationship.

## Self-Service Session Tips

When a respondent completes the self-service package independently and sends you their results:

1. **Accept partial data** — They may not have captured all answer details, just their score. That's sufficient for routing.
2. **Check for consistency** — If their reported score is high but their free-text summary describes significant problems, note the discrepancy in the response file.
3. **Follow up on low-band results promptly** — A low-band self-service result with no follow-up looks like you sent a quiz and didn't care about the result.
