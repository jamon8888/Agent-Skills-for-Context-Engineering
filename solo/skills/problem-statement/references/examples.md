## Tips for Writing Problem Statements

1. **Start with the narrative** — Helps you think from user's perspective
2. **Include emotion** — "Which makes me feel..." captures the human impact
3. **Quantify impact** — Time lost, money lost, frequency
4. **Use real quotes** — Makes the problem tangible
5. **Validate with 5-10 users** — Confirm it's real, not just one person's opinion
6. **Focus on the problem, not the solution** — Resist jumping to "we need feature X"
