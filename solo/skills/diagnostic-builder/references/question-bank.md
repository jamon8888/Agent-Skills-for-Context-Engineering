# Question Bank: Tested Patterns by Diagnostic Type

Questions that produce clean signal. Each is structured with 4 answer options scored 0–1–3–4 (no score of 2 — forces distinction between ambiguous and good).

## Writing Principles

**The 0-1-3-4 scale (no 2):**
Using 0, 1, 3, 4 instead of 0, 1, 2, 3 creates a forced distinction between "somewhat" and "mostly." The gap between 1 and 3 is intentional — there's no comfortable middle ground.

**Answer option construction:**
- Score 0: The clearest negative signal. Usually specific and concrete.
- Score 1: Negative lean, with some awareness or intent.
- Score 3: Positive lean, not yet complete.
- Score 4: The clearest positive signal. Specific and concrete.

**Tone rules:**
- Never use "bad" or "good" in answer options — this telegraphs scoring
- Write answers in first person ("I" statements) — easier to select honestly
- Make score 0 non-shameful — respondents should feel comfortable selecting it
- The options should form a natural progression, not obvious jumps
