# Talking Points for Scope Management

Scripts and phrases for navigating scope conversations with clients. Choose the approach that fits the situation and your communication style.

## Scenario 1: Client Makes a New Request

**Goal:** Acknowledge the idea positively while framing it as a potential change.

**Option A — Enthusiastic redirect:**
> "That's a great idea. It's not something we included in the original scope, but I'm happy to explore what it would take to add it. I can put together a quick change request that outlines the impact on our timeline and budget."

**Option B — Professional pause:**
> "I love the enthusiasm. Let me take a look at our current scope and I'll get back to you tomorrow on how we can best incorporate this."

**Option C — Immediate framing:**
> "Interesting idea! Just to be transparent — this falls outside our current agreement. I want to make sure we handle it properly so there are no surprises. Let me document it as a change request."

## Scenario 2: Presenting a Change Request

**Goal:** Be clear, confident, and focused on transparency. Never apologize for having a process.

**Option A — Collaborative:**
> "To make sure we're on the same page, I've documented the new feature you requested and its impact on the project. As you can see, it will add about [X days] to the timeline and [Y EUR] to the budget. If you're happy with that, I can get started right away."

**Option B — Options-based:**
> "I've looked at your request and have two options for you:
> - **Option A:** We add the feature now. Timeline extends by [X days], cost increases by [Y EUR].
> - **Option B:** We deliver the current scope on time, and tackle this as a follow-up project.
> Which would you prefer?"

**Option C — Written follow-up:**
> "Following up on our conversation about [feature]. I've attached a change request document with the full breakdown. Please review and let me know if you'd like to proceed. I'll hold off on starting until I have your confirmation."

## Scenario 3: Saying "No" (or "Not Now")

**Goal:** Decline the request politely while preserving the relationship.

### The "Parking Lot" Method
*Best for: Good ideas that aren't urgent*
> "That's a fantastic idea for Phase 2. For now, let's focus on delivering the core functionality we agreed on to make sure we hit our current deadline. I've added your idea to our 'parking lot' list to review as soon as this phase is complete."

### The "Resource Constraint" Method
*Best for: Requests that would compromise existing deliverables*
> "I'd love to do that, but given our current timeline, adding that feature would mean we couldn't complete [critical deliverable] on time. My priority is to deliver the core value we planned for, so I'd recommend we stick to the original scope for now."

### The "Expertise" Method
*Best for: When you know the request isn't in the client's best interest*
> "I appreciate the idea. Based on my experience, I'd actually recommend we wait on this until [reason — e.g., 'we have user feedback on the first version']. That way we can make a more informed decision about the implementation."

### The "Contract Reference" Method
*Best for: Repeat offenders or clients who push boundaries*
> "I want to make sure we stay aligned. Per Section [X] of our agreement, any changes to the agreed scope require a written change request. I'm happy to draft one if you'd like to formally explore this addition."

## Scenario 4: Client Pushes Back on the Change Request Fee

**Goal:** Hold firm without being adversarial.

**Option A — Value framing:**
> "I understand the budget concern. The reason I price change requests separately is to protect the quality of the work we've already agreed on. Rushing additional features into the current scope without proper planning is how projects go off the rails."

**Option B — Compromise:**
> "I hear you. Here's what I can do — I can reduce the scope of the addition to [simplified version] which would bring the cost down to [lower amount]. We could always expand it later."

**Option C — Firm but fair:**
> "I completely understand. To be transparent, the original price was based on the original scope. Additional work requires additional time and resources. I want to give this the attention it deserves rather than squeeze it in and risk the quality of everything else."

---

## Scenario 5: Recurring Scope Creep (Pattern Detected)

**Goal:** Address the pattern directly and establish a sustainable process.

> "I've noticed we've had several additional requests over the past few weeks that fall outside our original scope. I want to make sure we're both happy with how this project is going. Can we schedule a quick call to:
> 1. Review the original scope together
> 2. Discuss which additions are highest priority for you
> 3. Agree on a process for handling future changes
>
> This will help us stay on track and avoid any surprises on either side."
