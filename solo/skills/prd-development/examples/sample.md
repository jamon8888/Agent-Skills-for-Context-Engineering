# PRD Examples

### Example 1: A Good PRD (Guided Onboarding)

Refer to the main guide sections for a detailed example of a well-structured PRD covering all 10 sections.

**Why it works:**

- Clear problem statement with evidence (interviews, analytics, support tickets).
- Personas based on research.
- Solution description at the right level of detail (not too prescriptive).
- Success metrics with numerical targets.
- User stories with precise acceptance criteria.
- Explicitly documented out of scope.

### Example 2: A Bad PRD (Feature List)

**Problem Statement:**

> "Users want better onboarding."

**Solution:**

> "Add onboarding."

**Requirements:**

> "1. Onboarding flow 2. Tooltips 3. Help docs"

**Why it fails:**

- No evidence (who wants this? why?).
- No personas (who are the "users"?).
- No success metrics (how do we measure "better"?).
- No acceptance criteria (what does "onboarding flow" mean?).
- No strategic context (why now?).

**Correction with the PRD workflow:**

- **Phase 2:** Write a problem statement with evidence from discovery interviews.
- **Phase 3:** Define the persona (Sam the Solopreneur).
- **Phase 6:** Define success metrics (activation rate 40% → 60%).
- **Phase 7:** Break down "onboarding flow" into user stories with acceptance criteria.
