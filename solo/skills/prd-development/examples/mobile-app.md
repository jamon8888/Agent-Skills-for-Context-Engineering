# PRD Example: "Focus Flow" Mobile App

**Objective**: A minimalist timer and habit tracker that blocks distracting apps.

## 1. Context

Freelancers struggle with "Focus fragmentation." Modern smartphones are designed to distract. Focus Flow solves this by combining a Pomodoro timer with a radical app-blocking kernel.

## 2. Requirements

- **Feature A (The Timer)**: Pomodoro (25/5) with custom alert sounds.
- **Feature B (The Blocker)**: Block 5 chosen apps (e.g., Slack, Twitter) while the timer is running.
- **Feature C (The Log)**: Record every successful focus session in the `data/` folder.

## 3. User Stories

1.  **[SKELETON]**: As a user, I want to start a 5-minute timer so I can verify the app works.
2.  **[CORE]**: As a user, I want to see a countdown on my lock screen.
3.  **[VALUE]**: As a user, I want to see a weekly summary of my "Deep Work" hours.

## 4. Success Metrics

- 20% increase in "Weekly Deep Work Hours" reported by early testers.
- <5% churn in the first 7 days.
