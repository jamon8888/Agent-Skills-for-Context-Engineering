# The Client Relationship Architecture: Beyond a Simple CRM

For a solopreneur, every client relationship is high-stakes. This architecture moves you from a "passive database" to an "active relationship engine." Use this template to manage your most valuable business assets.

## 🏗 The Client Master File (data/1-Projets/clients/[Client].md)

Each client master file is a strategic document. It combines CRM data with deep psychographic context (Ref: `icp-creator`).

### 1. Strategic Identity (The Anchor)

- **Client/Company**: [Full Name]
- **Target Persona**: [Link to ICP node]
- **Market Positioning**: [How do they see you?]
- **Engagement Model**: [Subscription | Fixed Fee | Retainer]

### 2. The Client Health Matrix (CHM)

_Evaluate this every 30 days. Be brutally honest._

| Category             | Score (1-5) | Warning Signals                                         |
| :------------------- | :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Profitability**    |     [X]     | Is the billable vs. manual ratio under 0.6?             |
| **Communication**    |     [X]     | Are they slow to pay or vague in feedback?              |
| **Strategic Fit**    |     [X]     | Does this work help your `business-profile.json` goals? |
| **Growth Potential** |     [X]     | Is there a path to a high-tier retainer?                |

### 3. Lead & Pipeline Management (The Stage)

Track the lifecycle of the relationship:

- **[STAGE] Discovery**: Identifying pain points via `discovery-interview-prep`.
- **[STAGE] Proposal**: Drafting the `Triple Tier` pricing options.
- **[STAGE] Active**: Managing the current `Walking Skeleton` or `V1.0` build.
- **[STAGE] Retention**: Monthly advisory and strategic check-ins.
- **[STAGE] Sunset**: Professional offboarding (Ref: `eol-message`).

---

### 4. Strategic Memory (Discovery Log)

_Capture high-signal quotes that can be used for future sales._

- **The "Aha" Moment**: "[Quote from client about when the value became clear]"
- **The "Unmet Need"**: "[Something they complained about that isn't in scope yet]"
- **The "Champion"**: [Who inside the company is your biggest advocate?]

---

## 5. Implementation Workflow

1.  **Onboard**: Trigger the `client-management` skill to create the master file.
2.  **Audit**: Run a "Health Check" session every Friday during your `Weekly Beat`.
3.  **Propose**: Use the "Unmet Needs" from Section 4 to pitch your next `Project` or `Subscription`.

## 🔗 Internal Links Protocol

- **Contracts**: [Link to Agreement](file:///data/1-Projets/clients/legal/[Client]-contract.md)
- **Financials**: [Link to Invoices](file:///data/1-Projets/clients/billing/[Client]-invoices.md)
- **Success Metrics**: [Link to Outcomes](file:///data/1-Projets/[ProjectName]/ost.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A CRM is not a history of what happened; it is a **roadmap of what will happen next**. If a client file hasn't been updated in 30 days, the relationship is "At Risk."
