# Solo Quick Start Guide 🚀

Follow these 4 steps to set up your solopreneur operating system in under 5 minutes.

---

## 1. Installation

Ensure you have the Solo plugin installed in your Claude desktop or web environment.

## 2. Onboarding (`/solo:start`)

Run the onboarding command. Claude will walk you through a series of questions to build your **Business Profile**.

```bash
/solo:start
```

**What happens:**

- Solo creates your `business-profile.json` and `skill-config.json`.
- It identifies which of the 64 skills are most relevant to your specific business.
- It updates your `CLAUDE.md` to reflect your new setup.

## 3. Define Your Voice & Audience

For the content and sales tools to work effectively, Solo needs to know who you are and who you serve.

- **Audience**: "Define my target audience" or "Create an /solo:prospect"
- **Voice**: "Analyze my writing style to create my Voice DNA"

## 4. Run Your First Workflow

Try a core solopreneur workflow right away:

### A. Market Research

```bash
/solo:research market "new trends in AI-powered design tools"
```

### B. Content Creation

```bash
/solo:write blog "How to scale a one-person business in 2026"
```
